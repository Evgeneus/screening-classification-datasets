"The role of social support networks in proxy Internet use from the intergenerational solidarity perspective. Digital inequalities research has documented a set of practices related to people's Internet use that questions the binary division between Internet users and non-users. In particular, among older adults, a considerably large group of individuals has been identified as not using the Internet by themselves; rather, they ask members of their personal networks to do things online for them—they “use” the Internet by proxy. Since previous research shows that children and grandchildren are important sources of help when it comes to Internet use, the current paper indicates that the notion of intergenerational solidarity is a sound conceptual basis for understanding the relationship between social support networks and proxy Internet use among Internet non-users. Notably, the concept of functional solidarity as a dimension of intergenerational solidarity is advanced, as this relates to the frequency of the intergenerational exchange of resources and services encompassing various types of assistance and support offered between two generations. Empirically, this paper investigates how the two types of social support networks and their characteristics are associated with proxy Internet use. The results from multivariate analyses of survey data from a nation-wide representative sample show that when comparing emotional support and socializing networks, only the latter is associated with proxy Internet use: Internet non-users who have (grand-)children in their socializing support network are more likely to engage in proxy Internet use. The results also indicate that non-users who are younger, more educated, have children, and live in urban areas are more inclined to engage in proxy Internet use, regardless of the type of social support. The findings indicate the importance of empirical investigation related to different aspects of functional solidarity, as the effects on proxy Internet use depend on the type of social support. © 2017",0,0,0,0
"IT-based wellness tools for older adults: Design concepts and feedback. Objective: To explore older adults’ preferences regarding e-health applications through use of generated concepts that inform wellness tool design. Methods: The 6-8-5 method and affinity mapping were used to create e-health design ideas that were translated into storyboards and scenarios. Focus groups were conducted to obtain feedback on the prototypes and included participant sketching. A qualitative analysis of the focus groups for emerging themes was conducted, and sketches were analyzed. Results: Forty-three older adults participated in six focus group sessions. The majority of participants found the wellness tools useful. Preferences included features that supported participants in areas of unmet needs, such as ability to find reliable health information, cognitive training, or maintaining social ties. Participants favored features such as use of voice navigation, but were concerned over cost and the need for technology skills and access. Sketches reinforced these wants, including portability, convenience, and simplicity. Conclusions: Several factors were found to increase the desirability of such devices including convenient access to their health and health information, a simple, accessible interface, and support for memory issues. Researchers and designers should incorporate the feedback of older adults regarding wellness tools, so that future designs meet the needs of older adults. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",1,0,0,1
"Older adults experiences of online social interactions: A phenomenological study. Introduction: Online social networks allow users, who are anywhere in the world, to communicate with other people with text, audio, and video. Studies have shown that older adults use of social networks and online communication can increase social support, improve quality of life and increase their health. The purpose of this study was to understand the older adult's experiences of online Social Interactions. Materials and Methods: This study was performed following a qualitative approach and phenomenological methodology in Semnan (Iran) in 2016. The studied sample was taken by purposive sampling method. Required data was collected via deep and semi-structured interviews with 9 older adults who were active members of at least one online social network. The obtained data was analyzed using the seven-step Colaizzi's method. Results: From data analysis, the main theme of ""developed social interactions"" was extracted from five sub-themes: ""interaction with family and friends"", ""revival of old relationships"", ""familiar with people with common interests"", ""impalpable control"" and ""liberation from loneliness"". Conclusion: The results explained the various dimensions of the use of the older adults from online social networks and showed that these networks have the potential to be used to enhance social interactions in aging. The results of this study can help planners by identifying the benefits of these networks, while taking necessary interventions to increase the use of the elderly from these networks, promote social interactions and, consequently, promote the health of the elderly. © 2018, Semnan University of Medical Sciences.

"What drives live-stream usage intention? The perspectives of flow, entertainment, social interaction, and endorsement. Live-stream is the real-time audio and video transmission of an event over the Internet. Since a live-stream can also be interactive, it has some of the characteristics of a small community. People often become addicted to television, movies, or video blogs for the sake of entertainment. They can also become blind and obsessive about worshiping popular idols. Moreover, their willingness to use media is affected by their own perception of the media or their expectation of the benefits. This study therefore proposes four key factors: flow, entertainment, social interaction, and endorsement. We use path analysis to test their relationships with attitude, perceived value and watching intention to understand the influential factors and channels that induce audiences to watch live-streaming events. Analysis of 313 valid responses to a survey questionnaire indicate that approximately 65% of Taiwanese people watch live-streams via social network sites. In general, they watched live-streams simply because they liked to do so. The main reason behind their favorable impression of live-streaming was that live-streams made people happy and relieved stress. Secondly, people were attracted by the charm of the streamers, but the attraction differs slightly by gender. Females developed a more favorable impression of a live-stream when they admired the streamer. Males, on the other hand, developed a more favorable impression of a live-stream when they interacted with the streamer or other audience members. Young people tended to like live-streaming because it gave them a sense of flow, while older people were not affected by flow. This study contributes to the development of live-stream services and future studies on live-streaming. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0,0,0,0
"You're not really a visitor, you're just a friend': How older volunteers navigate home visiting. At the intersection of increasing social support needs due to population ageing and the promotion of older age as a time of contribution and social connection, volunteering is an important focus with advantages for older people. One service that addresses both these imperatives is home visiting services. Home visiting services connect home visitors with isolated older people. To examine how older people navigate volunteering for a home visiting service, six visitors were interviewed and the interviews were analysed using discourse analysis. A professionalism discourse was used to construct home visiting as a structured social support service that improved the lives of isolated older people. A personal relationship discourse constructed home visiting as an opportunity to forge long-term relationships that benefit both parties. At times these two discourses created tension for home visitors. Examining how the home visiting service is described by the service organisation online explains these tensions. The online materials construct active older volunteers as providing professional services while those they visit are constructed as receiving friendship. These discourses provide different ageing identities for visitors from those they visit, which contributes to the difficulties in navigating home visiting services. Addressing these tensions will enable service co-ordinators to better meet the needs of both visitors and clients in the context of increasing need for such services. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",1,0,0,0
"Dead Media Objects and the Experience of the (Once) Modern. Ethnographic Perspectives from the Living Rooms of Kinshasa’s Old Aged. This article departs from the observation that in many living rooms of elderly Kinois (inhabitants of Kinshasa), old and defunctive radio and television sets are put on display. When their primary function, to inform, has been rendered obsolete, we are faced with the question why people continue to display these objects, often next to newer models, in their living rooms. The main argument is that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) commodities, old and new, defective and repaired, are primarily social objects that are embedded in complex webs of practices and expectations which unsettle the taken-for-granted associations between technology and time. ICT objects are shown to be metonyms of dynamics in social relationships between owners of these ICT goods and others; and, although seemingly paradoxically, these same objects, even when damaged, inhabit promises for a better future. The article thus offers an alternative perspective on electronic modernity, and in particular, the role of Africa therein. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",1,0,0,0
"Exercising older people´s brains in Costa Rica: Design principles for using information and communication technologies for cognitive activity and social interaction. This study is part of a design-based research project aimed at designing a learning intervention for enabling Costa Rican older people to use information and communication technologies for cognitive activity and social interaction. Data from relevant literature, a focus group with older adults, and interviews with professionals teaching older adults how to use information and communication technologies were analyzed, in order to create context-sensitive design principles that could guide the design of learning interventions that meet the needs of older learners. The analysis derived context-sensitive design principles that include wider topics that influence the learning process, such as emotions and stereotypes related to learning about and using information and communication technologies, as well as the social support to that learning. The resulting eight design principles argue for respectful learning environments, in-depth comprehension of changes related to aging, time and space to reflect on emotions related to the learning process, and acknowledgment of participants’ individuality. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",1,0,0,0
"Technophobia among older Internet users. Internet use may be helpful in maintaining older adults’ independence, social connectedness, and quality of life. High levels of technophobia (fear of modern technologies or discomfort with them), however, may constrain older Internet users’ online activity and limit the benefits they derive therefrom. The literature on technophobia in later life tends to focus on nonusers and ignore older individuals who already use advanced technologies. Relying on an online survey of 537 Internet users aged 60 and up, this study explored the extent to which technophobia constrains older users’ online activity. The results demonstrated varying levels of technophobia among users and significant associations between technophobia and Internet use patterns, including type and complexity of use. Technophobia also correlated with users’ education, perceived health and well-being: Technophobes tended to be less satisfied with their lives—a correlation that remained significant even after controlling for background variables and online activities. The findings suggest that technophobia plays a role at both the first and second levels of the digital divide among seniors. They also indicate that technophobia may be a risk factor in later life, suggesting that older users ought to be taken into account in planning measures to reduce technophobia among seniors. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",1,0,0,0
"Video-calls to reduce loneliness and social isolation within care environments for older people: An implementation study using collaborative action research. Background: Older people in care may be lonely with insufficient contact if families are unable to visit. Face-to-face contact through video-calls may help reduce loneliness, but little is known about the processes of engaging people in care environments in using video-calls. We aimed to identify the barriers to and facilitators of implementing video-calls for older people in care environments. Methods: A collaborative action research (CAR) approach was taken to implement a video-call intervention in care environments. We undertook five steps of recruitment, planning, implementation, reflection and re-evaluation, in seven care homes and one hospital in the UK. The video-call intervention 'Skype on Wheels' (SoW) comprised a wheeled device that could hold an iPad and handset, and used Skype to provide a free video-call service. Care staff were collaborators who implemented the intervention within the care-setting by agreeing the intervention, recruiting older people and their family, and setting up video-calls. Field notes and reflective diaries on observations and conversations with staff, older people and family were maintained over 15 months, and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Four care homes implemented the intervention. Eight older people with their respective social contacts made use of video-calls. Older people were able to use SoW with assistance from staff, and enjoyed the use of video-calls to stay better connected with family. However five barriers towards implementation included staff turnover, risk averseness, the SoW design, lack of family commitment and staff attitudes regarding technology. Conclusions: The SoW intervention, or something similar, could aid older people to stay better connected with their families in care environments, but if implemented as part of a rigorous evaluation, then co-production of the intervention at each recruitment site may be needed to overcome barriers and maximise engagement. © 2018 The Author(s).",1,1,1,1
"Validation of a Social Networks and Support Measurement Tool for Use in International Aging Research: The International Mobility in Aging Study. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a new instrument to assess social networks and social support (IMIAS-SNSS) for different types of social ties in an international sample of older adults. The study sample included n = 1995 community dwelling older people aged between 65 and 74 years from the baseline of the longitudinal International Mobility in Aging Study (IMIAS). In order to measure social networks for each type of social tie, participants were asked about the number of contacts, the number of contacts they see at least once a month or have a very good relationship with, or speak with at least once a month. For social support, participants had to rate the level of social support provided by the four types of contacts for five Likert scale items. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was conducted to determine the goodness of fit of the measurement models. Satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices confirmed the satisfactory factorial structure of the IMIAS-SNSS instrument. Reliability coefficients were 0.80, 0.81, 0.85, and 0.88 for friends, children, family, and partner models, respectively. The models were confirmed by CFA for each type of social tie. Moreover, IMIAS-SNSS detected gender differences in the older adult populations of IMIAS. These results provide evidence supporting that IMIAS-SNSS is a psychometrically sound instrument and of its validity and reliability for international populations of older adults. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",1,0,0,0
Improving older people's life satisfaction via social networking site use: Evidence from China. Objective: This study aimed to examine the pathways by which social networking sites (SNSs) can improve older people's life satisfaction. Methods: We conducted an online survey in China that lasted eight weeks. Respondents were required to report their demographic characteristics and feelings regarding SNS use. Data were analysed using SPSS 20 and Amos 21. Results: We collected 596 valid samples. The empirical results show that SNS use improves older people's life satisfaction by reducing their loneliness and improving their self-efficacy. Social support alleviates the negative effect of loneliness and enhances the positive effect of self-efficacy on life satisfaction. Sex differences and education differences were significant. Men and less educated people had higher levels of life satisfaction. Conclusion: Policymakers should offer support to SNSs targeting older people and encourage them to provide more useful services. SNS operators should encourage social support among older users and pay attention to sex differences and education differences. © 2018 AJA Inc.,1,0,0,1
"Family poly-victimization and cyberbullying among adolescents in a Chinese school sample. The sustained increase in their use of social networking facilitates the development of adolescents but comes with the risk of cyberbullying, which creates new challenges in regard to adolescent protection. Past evidence shows that family victimization may play an essential role in the way adolescents learn cyberbullying behaviors. Yet, research on the co-occurrence of family victimization and cyberbullying is limited. This study aims to investigate the associations between cyberbullying and family victimization among adolescents, and to examine the health correlates of cyberbullying and family poly-victimization. A large sample of 18,341 students, aged 15–17, from six cities in China, collected between 2009 and 2010 is employed in the present study, which investigated the association between various kinds of family victimization and adolescent cyberbullying. Data analysis was conducted in 2017. In-law conflict, intimate partner violence, elder abuse and neglect, and child maltreatment were associated with a higher possibility of children becoming internet victims. Parents’ divorce and separation, low family income, mother's low level of education, and father's unemployment were all associated with cyberbullying victimization. Cyber victimization was positively correlated to symptoms of PTSD and depression, self-harm, and other physical and mental health variables. Possible explanations for the relationships found in this study are discussed and implications for future research and services are provided. Proactive screening for family poly-victimization and cyberbullying is suggested. Schools are highly recommended to cooperate with parents to promote cyber safety. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",0,0,0,0
"Acceptance of information and communication technologies by older adults: Role of relatives in device usage by older adults [Akzeptanz von Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien bei Senioren: Rolle der Angehörigen bei der Nutzung durch Senioren]. Background: Considering the fundamental changes in everyday life that accompany rising age, the need to support older adults regarding information and communication technologies (ICT) is increasing. Contact with new technology is a problem for many older adults. Objective: The goal of the present study was to examine how family members support older adults in the acquisition and usage of ICT. Methods: In the qualitative preliminary study, structured interviews with older adults (n = 5) and their family members (n = 6) were performed, which included questions on technology biography, technology acquisition and the effect of the technology usage on the social network. The results were part of the questionnaire of the main study. The main study was part of an accompanying intervention study. A total of 46 adults older than 60 years were included. In addition to aspects from the preliminary study, questions to sex-specific differences regarding the technical support of the social network were also analyzed. Results: Data analysis revealed that mainly family members purchase ICT for the older adults, and they are the main contact persons for technical problems. Above all, the seniors asked their own children for advice. Moreover, seniors who had increased technology use in everyday life (95.7%, n = 22) and higher technology acceptance (mean = 44.0, standard deviation = 7.4) had already had previous experience with technology during school age/career. Conclusion: In the households of older adults, fewer new ICT are found. The interest to purchase ICT is triggered by the technology support of family members. If the technical assistance was distributed to several members of the family and other networks, the burden of an individual family member could be reduced. In addition, the influence of different participants could increase the technology usage of older adults. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland.",1,0,0,1
"Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States. Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

"Internet use, social networks, loneliness, and quality of life among adults aged 50 and older: mediating and moderating effects. Background: The increase in longevity of people on one hand, and on the other hand the fact that the social networks in later life become increasingly narrower, highlights the importance of Internet use to enhance quality of life (QoL). However, whether Internet use increases or decreases social networks, loneliness, and quality of life is not clear-cut. Purposes: To explore the direct and/or indirect effects of Internet use on QoL, and to examine whether ethnicity and time the elderly spent with family moderate the mediation effect of Internet use on quality of life throughout loneliness. Methods: This descriptive-correlational study was carried out in 2016 by structured interviews with a convenience sample of 502 respondents aged 50 and older, living in northern Israel. Bootstrapping with resampling strategies was used for testing mediation a model. Results: Use of the Internet was found to be positively associated with QoL. However, this relationship was mediated by loneliness, and moderated by the time the elderly spent with family members. In addition, respondents’ ethnicity significantly moderated the mediation effect between Internet use and loneliness. Conclusions: Internet use can enhance QoL of older adults directly or indirectly by reducing loneliness. However, these effects are conditional on other variables. The indirect effect moderated by ethnicity, and the direct effect moderated by the time the elderly spend with their families. Researchers and practitioners should be aware of these interactions which can impact loneliness and quality of life of older persons differently. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",0,0,0,1
"Comparing daily drivers of problem drinking among older and younger adults: An electronic daily diary study using smartphones. Background: By 2030, numbers and proportions of older adults with substance-use problems are expected to increase. While risk factors for problem drinking in late life have been identified, it remains unknown whether these factors drive daily drinking among older problem drinkers. This study examined the daily drivers of drinking among problem drinkers, moderated by age, utilizing ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Method: Participants (N = 139), ages 20–73, received daily EMA online surveys completed via a smartphone prior to initiation of treatment. Multilevel modeling tested the moderating impact of age on within- and between-person relationships between drinking and focal predictors (mood, loneliness, boredom, stress, poor sleep, social factors, alcohol salience, commitment and confidence not to drink heavily). Results: Older adults reported greater alcohol consumption when daily boredom levels were higher. Heavier drinking among younger adults was associated with poorer sleep quality. Greater daily confidence, daily commitment and daily alcohol salience did not impact drinking to the same extent for older adults as for younger adults. Greater person-level commitment predicted reduced drinking equivalently across age, but low person-level commitment predicted greater drinking among older adults compared to their younger counterparts. Conclusion: Older adults may have unique daily drivers of drinking that are not fully realized in current research and intervention efforts. Addressing the growing substance-use treatment needs among this population will require identifying the unique drivers of drinking among older adults, such as boredom, when compared to younger adults. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",0,0,0,1
"ROBIN, a Telepresence Robot to Support Older Users Monitoring and Social Inclusion: Development and Evaluation. Introduction: This article describes an enhanced telepresence robot named ROBIN, part of a telecare system derived from the GIRAFFPLUS project for supporting and monitoring older adults at home. ROBIN is integrated in a sensor-rich environment that aims to continuously monitor physical and psychological wellbeing of older persons living alone. The caregivers (formal/informal) can communicate through it with their assisted persons. Long-term trials in real houses highlighted several user requirements that inspired improvements on the robotic platform. The enhanced telepresence robot was assessed by users to test its suitability to support social interaction and provide motivational feedback on health-related aspects. Methods: Twenty-five users (n = 25) assessed the new multimodal interaction capabilities and new communication services. A psychophysiological approach was adopted to investigate aspects like engagement, usability, and affective impact, as well as the possible role of individual differences on the quality of human-robot interaction. Results: ROBIN was overall judged usable, the interaction with/through it resulted pleasant and the required workload was limited, thus supporting the idea of using it as a central component for remote assistance and social participation. Open-minded users tended to have a more positive interaction with it. Conclusions: This work describes an enabling technology for remote assistance and social communication. It highlights the importance of being compliant with users' needs to develop solutions easy to use and able to foster their social connections. The role of personality appeared to be relevant for the interaction, underscoring a clear role of the service personalization. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.",1,0,0,1
"Energy efficient wearable sensor node for IoT-based fall detection systems. Falls can cause serious traumas such as brain injuries and bone fractures, especially among elderly people. Fear of falling might reduce physical activities resulting in declining social interactions and eventually causing depression. To lessen the effects of a fall, timely delivery of medical treatment can play a vital role. In a similar scenario, an IoT-based wearable system can pave the most promising way to mitigate serious consequences of a fall while providing the convenience of usage. However, to deliver sufficient degree of monitoring and reliability, wearable devices working at the core of fall detection systems are required to work for a prolonged period of time. In this work, we focus on energy efficiency of a wearable sensor node in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based fall detection system. We propose the design of a tiny, lightweight, flexible and energy efficient wearable device. We investigate different parameters (e.g. sampling rate, communication bus interface, transmission protocol, and transmission rate) impacting on energy consumption of the wearable device. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption of the wearable in different configurations and operating conditions. Furthermore, we provide hints (hardware and software) for system designers implementing the optimal wearable device for IoT-based fall detection systems in terms of energy efficiency and high quality of service. The results clearly indicate that the proposed sensor node is novel and energy efficient. In a critical condition, the wearable device can be used continuously for 76 h with a 1000 mAh li-ion battery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0,0,0,0
"Associations of Environmental Factors with Quality of Life in Older Adults. Purpose of the Study: Environmental factors play an important role in the quality of life of older people who often have difficulty maintaining physical, psychological, and social functioning. In this study, we aimed at (a) developing a measurement instrument assessing the factors of older adults' perceptions of their environment, (b) examining the associations of these environmental factors with quality of life domains physical health, psychological, social relations, and environmental, controlling for background characteristics. Design and Methods: Associations between environmental factors and quality of life domains were examined in a crosssectional study using a sample of 1,031 Dutch people aged 65 years and older. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire, the ""Senioren Barometer."" Forty-two questions on environmental factors were asked, and quality of life domains were assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF. Results: Seven scales (comprising 3-9 items) of environment were constructed-housing, facilities, nuisance, residents, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic. All quality of life domains (physical, psychological, social, environmental) were associated with at least one environmental scale. Housing, residents, and nuisance were associated with 4, 3, and 2 domains, respectively. Facilities, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic were associated only with quality of life environmental. Implications: This study showed that multiple environmental factors are associated with quality of life in older people. To support independent living in older people health and social care professionals and policymakers may need to carry out interventions, in particular focusing on housing, residents, and nuisance. © 2017 The Author(s).

"The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial. Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

"Facebook Use and Its Role in Shaping Access to Social Benefits among Older Adults. Adults who are 65 years or older have increasingly adopted social network sites (SNSs), Facebook in particular. Yet the ramifications of SNS use in this population remain understudied. Using a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 2,003), this study focuses on Facebook users (N = 1,138) and examines patterns of Facebook use by younger (aged 18–65 years) and older users (aged 65 or older), as well as the social benefits associated with older users’ Facebook use. Findings show that older users have different network structures, but the frequency of their visits and engagement in Social Media Relationship Maintenance Behaviors (SMRMB), a measure of perceived likelihood to engage with others via social media, do not significantly differ from those of younger users. Moreover, our results suggest that among older users (N = 98), the number of self-reported “actual” friends on Facebook and SMRMB positively predict perceived support, while SMRMB contributes to perceptions of access to useful information. Overall, the study highlights unique usage patterns and social benefits associated with Facebook use among older adults. As such, its findings provide insights for the future design of technological interventions to help older adults better access social benefits associated with SNS use. © 2018 Broadcast Education Association.",1,0,0,0
"A traceable threshold attribute-based signcryption for mHealthcare social network. With the rapid development of wireless sensor technologies, mobile healthcare social network (MHSN) built upon wireless body sensor network (WBSN), has evolved into an innovative next-generation healthcare system in our aging society. Nevertheless, it is vital to focus on the security issues and the tradeoff between privacy preserving and traceability. A novel security mechanism named as the traceable threshold attribute-based signcryption (TTABSC) can permits patients to be friends and make a proper tradeoff between privacy and traceability. The proposed scheme leverages a four-party model to prevent the leak of a patient's sensitive information, including symptom information, identity and patient's health information (PHI). Combining the digital signatures and encryption, we provide a series of performance analysis, including correctness, unforgeability, traceability and privacy. Compared with previous works, our most efficient scheme generates a constant signcryption size. © Copyright 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",0,0,0,0
"User needs and preferences on AAL systems that support older adults and their carers. This article describes a systematic investigation on the expectations of potential users of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies.More specifically it describes the efforts made to elicit users expectations for services of an AAL system that aims to both monitor older people fostering their independent living and preventing dangerous situations and also offers a valid help to their caregivers. The specific target of our work is older adults, with no critical pathological conditions, who wish to stay home as long as possible. The work proposes a plan for a rigorous systematization of the users needs and their validation based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative research techniques involving both the primary users (older users at home) and the secondary users (formal and informal caregivers) who constitute the network of persons around them. Four main areas relevant to the realization of personalized services have been identified that could help to support independent living and improve Quality of Life (QoL) which include the monitoring of Social Interaction, Physiological Data, Daily Activities and Environmental Data. The presented results are also consistent with the global theoretical framework of International Classification of the Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) which highlights the main factors contributions to independent living. This study also investigates the perceived usefulness and acceptance of specific services (considering both primary and secondary users perspective) that have been listed inside each category with the aim to indicate a clear priority level and preferences of users. The article concludes by providing insights on practical implications for the systems development, presenting concrete examples of possible use cases relevant for the AAL domain linked to the elicited user requirements. © 2018 -IOS Press and the authors.

"Activating and Guiding the Engagement of Seniors With Online Social Networking: Experimental Findings From the AGES 2.0 Project. Objective: Guided by theoretical and empirical work attesting to the health benefits of social connections, we tested whether Internet connectivity, and training in its use for social purposes, can support the well-being of older adults receiving care. Method: Participants (N = 76) were randomly assigned to receive 3 months training versus care-as-usual. Cognitive and mental health were assessed before and after the intervention. Results: Results show significant cognitive improvements across time in the training, but not control, group. This effect was mediated through a combination of increased social activity, improved self-competence, and maintained personal identity strength. Indirect effects on mental health outcomes via these processes were also observed. Discussion: These findings suggest that Internet access and training can support the self and social connectedness of vulnerable older adults and contribute positively to well-being. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",1,1,1,1
"Persuasive games for intergenerational social interaction in urban environments. Social isolation in urban areas is a societal challenge. It affects people of all ages but particularly elderly who struggle to maintain social ties into later-life. Interventions in social isolation primarily focus on elderly in clinical care, overlooking the existence of older adults who live independently. Despite facing dwindling social contact, groups of healthy older adults reside alongside large groups of younger citizens that might offer much needed social interaction. This type of intergenerational social interaction seems promising but motivations of elderly to engage with younger groups who are not necessarily related to them are not well-understood and vice-versa. Persuasive games have the potential to encouraging social interaction. This paper presents a preliminary work on investigating motivations for intergenerational interaction rooted in persuasion theory. It proposes the use of the Integrated Behavior Model as a theoretical framework for understanding behavioral determinants and explores the use of games as a way of fostering changes in attitudes that could enhance intergenerational interactions. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2018.",1,0,0,0
"The use of facebook advertising to recruit healthy elderly people for a clinical trial: Baseline metrics. Background: This report provides data on the use of social media advertising as a clinical trial recruitment strategy targeting healthy volunteers aged 60 years and older. The social media advertising campaign focused on enrollment for a Phase 1 clinical trial. Traditional means of recruiting-billboards, newspaper advertising, word of mouth, personal referrals, and direct mail-were not producing enough qualified participants. Objective: To demonstrate the effectiveness of using targeted advertising on the social networking site Facebook to recruit people aged 60 years and older for volunteer clinical trial participation. Methods: The trial sponsor used a proactive approach to recruit participants using advertising on social media. The sponsor placed and monitored an Institutional Review Board-Approved advertising campaign on Facebook to recruit potential candidates for a Phase 1 clinical trial. The clinical trial required a 10-day residential (overnight) stay at a clinic in Michigan, with one follow-up visit. The sponsor of the clinical trial placed the advertising, which directed interested respondents to a trial-specific landing page controlled by the Contract Research Organization (CRO). The CRO provided all follow-up consenting, prescreening, screening, and enrollment procedures. The campaign was waged over an 8-week period to supplement recruiting by the CRO. Results: A total of 621 people responded to a Facebook advertising campaign by completing an online form or telephoning the CRO, and the clinical trial was fully enrolled at 45 subjects following an 8-week Facebook advertising campaign. Conclusions: An 8-week Facebook advertising campaign contributed to 868 inquiries made regarding a Phase 1 clinical trial seeking to enroll healthy elderly subjects. Over the initial 11 weeks of recruitment, 178 inquiries were received using traditional methods of outreach. Respondents to the Facebook advertising campaign described in this report engaged with the sponsored advertising at a higher rate than is typical for social media-based clinical trial recruitment strategies. The older adults' engagement rate of 4.92% was more than twice as high as click-Through rates of younger adults engaged with social media advertising in other clinical trial recruitment studies. Advertising placed on the social media platform Facebook is effective with the healthy volunteer population aged 60 years and older. This approach can quickly and cost-effectively reach qualified candidates for clinical trial recruitment as a supplement to traditional means of recruiting.

"Inclusion of service robots in the daily lives of frail older users: A step-by-step definition procedure on users′ requirements. The implications for the inclusion of robots in the daily lives of frail older adults, especially in relation to these population needs, have not been extensively studied. The “Multi-Role Shadow Robotic System for Independent Living” (SRS) project has developed a remotely-controlled, semi-autonomous robotic system to be used in domestic environments. The objective of this paper is to document the iterative procedure used to identify, select and prioritize user requirements. Seventy-four requirements were identified by means of focus groups, individual interviews and scenario-based interviews. The list of user requirements, ordered according to impact, number and transnational criteria, revealed a high number of requirements related to basic and instrumental activities of daily living, cognitive and social support and monitorization, and also involving privacy, safety and adaptation issues. Analysing and understanding older users’ perceptions and needs when interacting with technological devices adds value to assistive technology and ensures that the systems address currently unmet needs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",0,0,0,0
"Facilitating aging in place: A qualitative study of practical problems preventing people with dementia from living at home. Although the majority of people with dementia wish to age in place, they are particularly susceptible to nursing home admission. Nurses can play an important role in detecting practical problems people with dementia and their informal caregivers are facing and in advising them on various ways to manage these problems at home. Six focus group interviews (n = 43) with formal and informal caregivers and experts in the field of assistive technology were conducted to gain insight into the most important practical problems preventing people with dementia from living at home. Problems within three domains were consistently described as most important: informal caregiver/social network-related problems (e.g. high load of care responsibility), safety-related problems (e.g. fall risk, wandering), and decreased self-reliance (e.g. problems regarding self-care, lack of day structure). To facilitate aging in place and/or to delay institutionalization, nurses in community-based dementia care should focus on assessing problems within those three domains and offer potential solutions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,0,0
"Caring for carers of people with dementia: A protocol for harnessing innovation through deploying leading edge technologies to enable virtual support groups and services. In rural Australia, knowledge and utilisation of support by informal carers is lacking. During the caregiving period, socioemotional support from family and friends plays an important role in sustaining caregiving activities. Post-care, these social networks facilitate adjustment to role change and dealing with grief. Developing and improving access to peer support to enable carers to effectively cope with the challenges of caring may positively influence their caring experience. The primary objective of this project is to examine the response of isolated rural carers for older people with dementia to a videoconference (VC) based peer support and information program. Will participation in the program improve self-efficacy, quality of life, and mental health? Secondary objectives are to develop a VC based peer support program for isolated rural carers for older people with dementia, using a co-design approach; and to assess the feasibility of VC technology for enhancing social support to family caregivers in their homes. This project will collaboratively co-design and evaluate a facilitated VC peer support and information program to carers of people with dementia within rural areas. Carers will be recruited through community health and care providers. Program development will use an information sharing approach to facilitate social interaction. A focus of the project is to use off-the-shelf technology which will be more accessible than specialised bespoke solutions that are currently popular in this area of research. A mixed methods repeated measures randomized wait list design will be used to evaluate the project. The primary outcomes are self-efficacy, quality of life, and mental health. Secondary outcomes are perceived social support and user satisfaction with the technology, and intention to continue VC interaction. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.",0,0,0,0
"Photo alive!: Elderly oriented social communication service. Technological predilection among different generations for social interaction affected intergenerational communication gap. The rapid intensification of internet and increased technological mediums create digital divide among younger generation and elderly. Regrettably most elderly are unable to use Social media. Elderly people left behind in many areas of digital services platforms and technological skills. In this paper, we proposed a unique system for intergenerational communication based on digital family photos named as “Photo Alive!” to diminished intergenerational interaction problems. The development includes implementation and design of photo-based tagging service and photo-based interaction service with smart aging techniques. We concentrate on captivate of elderly in social media using digital photos with specific goal to enhance social interaction with family members, friends, and younger generation by providing elderly easy user interaction mediums on elderly tangible social service. The preliminary evaluation results indicate that the system is elderly friendly for social communication. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",1,0,0,0
"Design and Development of an Online Support System for Elder Care. An important issue in healthcare nowadays is the tremendous increase in the elder population worldwide. A consequence of this is that a significant amount of care to elders is provided by informal caregivers, such as family members, rather than health professionals. It is vital, therefore, to provide support to informal caregivers in a manner that makes them more effective while, at the same time, easing the burden of constant caregiving. This work presents a prototype of an online support system for informal caregivers to the elderly and its evaluation. The prototype has multiple modules which provide services including patient and caregiver profile management, care recommendation and planning, treatment notification, an information archive, as well as social interaction with other caregivers. Our prototype is web-based and caregivers may access it through a computer or a smartphone. Our evaluation of the prototype indicates more than 70% user satisfaction. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",0,0,0,0
"Supporting diverse challenges of ageing with digital enhanced living solutions. By the 2050, it is estimated that the proportion of people over the age of 80 will have risen from 3.9% to 9.1% of population of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. A large proportion of these people will need significant help to manage various chronic illnesses, including dementia, heart disease, diabetes, limited physical movement and many others. Current approaches typically focus on acute episodes of illness and are not well designed to provide adequately for daily living care support. In our rapidly ageing society, a critical need exists for effective, affordable, scalable and safe in- home and in-residential care solutions leveraging a range of current and emerging sensor, interaction and integration technologies. Key aims are to support the ageing to live longer in their own homes; make daily challenges associated with ageing less limiting through use of technology supports; better support carers - both professional and family - in providing monitoring, proactive intervention, and community connectedness; enable in-home and in-residential care organisations to scale their support services and better use their workforces; and ultimately provide better quality of life. Deakin University researchers have been investigating a range of emerging technologies and platforms to realise this vision, which we in broad terms coin Digital Enhanced Living, in the ageing space but also supporting those with anxiety and depression, sleep disorders, various chronic diseases, recovery from injury, and various predictive analytics. A Smart Home solution, carried out in conjunction with a local start-up, has produced and trialled a novel sensor, interaction, and AI- based technology. Virtual Reality (VR) solutions have been used to support carers in the set-up of dementia-friendly homes, in conjunction with Alzheimers Australia. Activity and nutrition solutions, including the use of conversational agents, have been used to build dialogue to engage and change behaviour. Predictive analytics, in conjunction with major hospitals, have been applied to large medical datasets to better support professionals making judgements around discharge outcomes. A set of lessons have been learned from the design, deployment and trialing of these diverse solutions and new development approaches have been crafted to address the challenges faced. In particular, we found that there is a need to consider user emotional expectations as first-class citizens and create methodologies that consider the user needs during the creation of the software solutions. We find that quality and emotional aspects have to be engineered into the solution, rather than added after a technical solution is deployed. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

"Development of a short form of the Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire (AAQ). Objectives: The original 24-item Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire (AAQ) is well established as a measure of attitudes to aging, comprising domains of psychosocial loss (PL), physical change (PC), and psychological growth (PG). This paper presents a new 12-item short form Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire (AAQ-SF). Methods: The original field trial data used to develop the 24-item AAQ (AAQ-24) were used to compare 6-item, 9-item, and 12-item versions of AAQ-SF (sample 1, n = 2487) and to test the discriminative validity of the selected 12-item AAQ-SF (sample 2, n = 2488). Data from a separate study reporting on the AAQ-24 (sample 3, n = 792) verified the analyses. Results: The 12-item AAQ-SF reported adequate internal consistency in both sample 1 (PL α =.72, PC α =.72, and PG α =.62) and sample 3 (PL α =.68, PC α =.73, and PG α =.61). The AAQ-SF functioned consistently with the profile of the AAQ-24 in that subscales in both formats of this measure discriminate between respondents on key parameters such as depression, subjective health status, and overall quality of life in sample 2. Sample 3 also demonstrated the AAQ-SF can detect the differences in attitudes toward aging between individuals experiencing anxiety and depression and those without psychological symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the structure of the AAQ-SF mirrors that of the original 24-item AAQ. Conclusions: The AAQ-SF is a robust measure of attitudes toward aging, which can reduce respondent burden when used within longer questionnaire batteries or longitudinal research.

"Dynamorph: Montessori inspired design for seniors with dementia living in long-term care facilities. Seniors with dementia living in nursing homes are often faced with boredom and loneliness due to lack of meaningful engagement and personalized activities. We applied Montessori method to design an interactive table for elderly home residents and evaluated the design with four female residents and a nurse. This method offers a range of levelled interactions to meet the needs at different stages and cognitive decline levels of the residents with dementia. The table initiates interaction with an increasing level of complexity that magnifies the rewarding effects and social connectedness among the residents. The qualitative evaluation during a pilot study indicated that the interactions with the table reduced agitation of the elderly participants and increased the instances of positive social behaviours. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2018.",1,1,1,0
"Grey Nomads’ caravanning use of social networking sites. The caravanning industry in Australia continues to grow, largely due to increasing participation amongst older adults (‘Grey Nomads’). Concurrently, communication technology is increasingly more mobile and the use of social networking sites (SNS) amongst older adults is at an unprecedented level. Through in-depth interviews with 29 Grey Nomads caravanning through Mid-West Western Australia, this study explores the use(s) of SNS amongst Grey Nomads. Respondents were classified as active, passive or non-users of SNS. Emergent themes effecting the use of SNS include its ‘perceived usefulness’ and the level of Grey Nomad ‘self-efficacy’. Grey Nomads have a pragmatic approach to SNS, acknowledging SNS allows them to ‘stay connected’ and is a useful ‘source of information’. This study contributes to initiating an understanding of how Grey Nomads use SNS within their caravanning environment. Stakeholders in the caravanning industry should ensure the incorporation and strategic use of SNS in their marketing and business operations. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",1,0,0,0
"Impact of Anticipated Bias from Healthcare Professionals on Perceived Successful Aging among Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Older Adults. Purpose: Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) persons have routinely experienced high rates of violence and discrimination. Discrimination in healthcare can affect the ability of TGNC persons to age successfully as it often deters them from seeking care. The purpose of this study was to determine if anticipation of bias from healthcare professionals, as well as other variables, predicted perceived successful aging in a sample of TGNC adults. Methods: A total of 384 (of the original 1963) participants older than 50 years completed the relevant parts of an 83-item online survey as part of the Trans MetLife Survey on Later-Life Preparedness and Perceptions in Transgender-Identified Individuals. Results: Larger social support networks and higher levels of confidence that a healthcare professional will treat them with dignity and respect as a TGNC person at the end of their life were associated with increased odds of perceiving that they were aging successfully. Conclusion: With high rates of discrimination and prejudice toward TGNC persons in various contexts (e.g., healthcare, education, and housing), it is imperative that practitioners, researchers, policymakers, and institutions work together to eradicate healthcare disparities, promote social change, and support an environment that encourages successful aging. This calls for a coordinated, proactive outreach effort to put trust back into a system that has historically let down an entire subset of the population. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",0,0,0,1
"‘Although we're isolated, we're not really isolated’: The value of information and communication technology for older people in rural Australia. Objective: Drawing from a larger study that identified the supports and services that facilitate wellness among older people from rural communities, this study examined the specific contribution made by information and communication technology (ICT). Methods: Qualitative interviews were undertaken with 60 older adults from six Australian rural areas. A preliminary thematic analysis was conducted, followed by a higher-order inductive analysis. Results: Information and communication technology use was discussed in terms of individual enrichment, and in terms of enabling connections between the individual and their social networks, community and wider service environments. Conclusion: Information and communication technologies may facilitate wellness for rural older people by compensating for geographical and social isolation. In the changing world of health and aged care service delivery, ICTs will be more important than ever for rural older people in building their capacity to access the services, socialisation and support that they need, regardless of location. © 2017 AJA Inc.",1,0,0,1
"Perspectives of health and self-care among older persons—To be implemented in an interactive information and communication technology-platform. Aim and objectives: To acquire knowledge regarding the contents to be implemented in an interactive information and communication technology-platform perceived to be relevant to health and self-care among older persons based on the literature, healthcare professionals and the older persons themselves. Background: The growing ageing population places demands on the healthcare system to promote healthy ageing and to strengthen the older person's self-care ability. This requires innovative approaches to facilitate communication between the older person and healthcare professionals, and to increase the older person's participation in their care. An information and communication technology-platform could be used for this purpose, but the content needs to be relevant to both the older persons and the healthcare professionals. Design: Descriptive qualitative design. Methods: This study was based on three samplings: a scoping review of the literature (n = 20 articles), interviews with healthcare professionals (n = 5) and a secondary analysis of interviews with older persons (n = 8) and nursing assistants (n = 7). The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Four areas were identified to be of relevance to older persons’ perceived health: frame of mind, having relationships and social activities, physical ability and concerns, and maintaining self-care. Self-care was described in the literature and by the healthcare professionals more than by the older persons. Conclusions: The results show a concordance in the data samplings that give a clear indication of the areas relevant to older persons’ health and self-care that can be integrated in an interactive information and communication technology-platform for use in regular daily care assessments. Descriptions of self-care were limited indicating a possible gap in knowledge that requires further research. Relevance to clinical practice: Areas relevant to older persons’ health and self-care could be used for regular assessment to support and promote healthy ageing. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",1,0,0,1
"Cumulative Dynamics of Independent Information Spreading Behaviour: A Physical Perspective. The popularization of information spreading in online social networks facilitates daily communication among people. Although much work has been done to study the effect of interactions among people on spreading, there is less work that considers the pattern of spreading behaviour when people independently make their decisions. By comparing microblogging, an important medium for information spreading, with the disordered spin glass system, we find that there exist interesting corresponding relationships between them. And the effect of aging can be observed in both systems. Based on the analogy with the Trap Model of spin glasses, we derive a model with a unified power-function form for the growth of independent spreading activities. Our model takes several key factors into consideration, including memory effect, the dynamics of human interest, and the fact that older messages are more difficult to discover. We validate our model by a real-world microblogging data set. Our work indicates that, other than various features, some invariable rules should be considered during spreading prediction. This work also contributes a useful methodology for studying human dynamics. © 2017 The Author(s).",0,0,0,0
"Preferences of smart shopping channels and their impact on perceived wellbeing and social inclusion. This study examines consumers’ interactions with retailers via three different shopping channels. Two of the channels are “smart” (technological) channels, comprising (i) where consumers shop using a computer and (ii) where consumers shop using a mobile phone. These two channels are compared with (iii) the traditional store channel. The paper explores the effect that consumers’ interactions with these channels has on their wellbeing, with a focus on individuals who perceive themselves as being socially excluded, for example, lacking access to goods, services and information. We make a connection between social exclusion and channel contribution to wellbeing for multiple channels, through the lens of the Theory of Planned Behaviour. The online survey findings (n = 1368) indicate that for each channel, there is a higher contribution to wellbeing for that channel for people who are more socially excluded. Social exclusion can have many underlying causes, but channel contributions to wellbeing remain for consumers suffering from financial stress and also those with mobility disability. For the mobile phone channel, the positive channel contributions to wellbeing are greater for younger than for older people. The paper outlines the implications for scholars and practitioners. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0,0,0,0
"Digital outreach: Designing technologies for diversity, participation and social inclusion. Digital participation is fast becoming a core issue for researchers, designers, educators, industry and the government. Yet, academic research, industry practices and government policies still tend to focus predominantly on mainstream communities of highly urbanized settlements, often neglecting smaller cities, regional areas, suburbia and disadvantaged segments of society lacking digital literacy. Likewise, people from diverse and marginalised backgrounds, or who are socially excluded, such as people living with disability, the elderly, disadvantaged youth and women, people identifying as LGBTI, refugees and migrants, Indigenous people and others, are particularly vulnerable to digital underparticipation. This workshop proposes to shift the discourse back into the discussion of: (a) design practices relevant to those communities; (b) identify shared challenges and opportunities; (c) uncover strategies for codesign with a wider range of demographics; and (d) devise a roadmap for a more inclusive research agenda around communities and technologies. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

"Computerized cognitive stimulation and engagement programs in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: Comparing feasibility, acceptability, and cognitive and psychosocial effects. Purpose: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with a higher risk of dementia and is becoming a topic of interest for pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions. With advances in technology, computer-based cognitive exercises are increasingly integrated into traditional cognitive interventions, such as cognitive training. Another type of cognitive intervention involving technology use is cognitive engagement, consisting of involving participants in highly motivational and mentally challenging activities, such as learning to use a form of new digital technology. This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a computerized cognitive stimulation (CCS) program and a computerized cognitive engagement (CCE) program, and then compared their effects in older adults with MCI. Patients and methods: In this randomized study, data from 19 MCI patients were analyzed (n=9 in CCS and n=10 in CCE). The patients attended a group weekly session for a duration of 3 months. Assessments of cognitive and psychosocial variables were conducted at baseline (M0) and at the end of the programs (M3). Results: All of the participants attended the 12 sessions and showed a high level of motivation. Attrition rate was very low (one dropout at M3 assessment). At M3, the CCS participants displayed a significant improvement in part B of the Trail Making Test (TMT-B; p=0.03) and self-esteem (p=0.005), while the CCE participants showed a significant improvement in part A of the Trail Making Test (TMT-A; p=0.007) and a higher level of technology acceptance (p=0.006). The two groups did not differ significantly (p>0.05) in cognitive and psychosocial changes after the intervention. However, medium effect sizes (Cohen’s d=0.56; 95% CI =-0.43:1.55) were found on the free recall, favoring the CCS group, as well as on TMT-A (d=0.51; 95% CI =-0.48:1.49) and technology acceptance (d=-0.65; 95% CI =-1.64:0.34), favoring the CCE group. Conclusion: Both interventions were highly feasible and acceptable and allowed improvement in different aspects of cognitive and psychosocial functioning in MCI subjects. © 2017 Djabelkhir et al.",1,1,1,1
"My-active and healthy ageing (My-AHA): An ICT platform to detect frailty risk and propose intervention. Stemming from a holistic view of interrelated frailties, cognitive decline, physical frailty, depression and anxiety, social isolation and poor sleep quality, My-AHA proposes an ICT platform for early detection of pre-frailty and intervention to sustain active and healthy ageing and slowing or reversing further decline. The main aim of My-AHA is to reduce frailty risk by improving physical activity and cognitive function, psychological state, social resources, nutrition, sleep and overall well-being in older adults with pre-frailty symptoms. It will empower older citizens to better manage their own health, providing new ways of health monitoring and disease prevention through individualized profiling and personalized recommendations, feedback and support. An ICT-based platform will detect defined risks in the frailty domains early and accurately via non-stigmatising embedded sensors and data readily available in the daily living environment of older adults. When risk is detected (pre-frail), My-AHA will provide targeted ICT-based interventions. These interventions will follow an integrated approach to motivate users to participate in physical exercise, cognitively stimulating games and social networking to achieve long-term behavioural change, sustained by continued end user engagement with My-AHA. A randomized controlled study (RCT), involving 300 subjects receiving intervention, and 300 controls from many EU and non EU countries, to evaluate intercultural aspects, is ongoing in order to evaluate efficacy of the my-AHA platform. The ultimate aim is to deliver significant innovation in the area of active and healthy ageing through cooperation between European health care organizations, SMEs, and NGOs.1 © 2017 University of Split, FESB.",0,0,0,0
A predictive model for automatic detection of social isolation in older adults. Social isolation is a problem that is accentuated in the stage of old age. This condition puts at risk the physical and mental integrity of older adults. This paper presents a predictive model for the automatic detection of social isolation in older adults. The predictive model was implemented in a mobile application that monitors communication and mobility activities performed by an older adult. The system also considers demographic aspects to improve the prediction results. The mobile application was also generated for a caregiver who is responsible for receiving notifications about the specific level of social isolation of the older adult. The predictive model was evaluated using an experimental group of older adults. © 2017 IEEE.,1,0,0,0
"FamilyPal: An effective system for detecting family activities based on smartphone. Taking part in family activities plays an important role in establishing good relationships with family members. It can solve the loneliness of elders, which related not only to their physical health, but also to the well-being of the whole family. In the paper, we propose FamilyPal, an effective system for detecting family activities, which can help users establish good relationship with family members. Specifically, FamilyPal firstly uses smartphones built-in sensors, such as GPS, accelerometer, microphone, gyroscope, and Wi-Fi to obtain the motion and location of users, the surrounding voice, etc. Secondly, with the sensed data, we propose an effective method based on Gaussian Mixtures Models (GMM) to detect family activities, including occurrence of meal, cooking, TV viewing, conversations, in an unobtrusive manner. Thirdly, we select appropriate sensors for classification to improve smartphones battery life. FamilyPal has been implemented on the Android platform and evaluation of the system with 10 subjects over one week shows that FamilyPal can accurately classify family activities with the average precision of 71%, the average recall of 73% and the F-measure of 71.99%. © 2017 IEEE.",1,1,1,0
"Social networking in the aging context: Why older adults use or avoid Facebook. Despite a growing body of research about older adults’ use of social networking sites (SNS), scholars have not fully explored how this technology is meeting this group's interactional and information-seeking needs. How do these older adults view this technology? What are their communication needs and expectations and why are they drawn to it? To address these questions and fill a gap in the literature, this study draws upon in-depth interviews with 46 older adults (average age: 80.4 years) about their perceptions of Facebook, which was the leading SNS at the time of writing. Analysis of interview data revealed six primary reasons for using Facebook (keeping in touch, sharing photos, social surveillance, responding to family member requests, convenient communication, curiosity) and six primary reasons for not using Facebook (privacy, need for media richness, preference for familiarity, triviality of communication, time commitment, frustration with site tools). Emergent findings hold implications for future research and SNS design. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",1,0,0,0
"Pilot testing a digital pet avatar for older adults. Social isolation in older adults is a major public health concern. An embodied conversational agent (ECA) has the potential to enhance older adults’ social interaction. However, little is known about older adults’ experience with an ECA. In this paper, we conducted a pilot study to examine the perceived acceptance and utility of a tablet-based conversational agent in the form of an avatar (termed “digital pet”) for older adults. We performed secondary analysis of data collected from a study that employed the use of a digital pet in ten older adults’ homes for three months. Most of the participants enjoyed the companionship, entertainment, reminders, and instant assistance from the digital pet. However, participants identified limited conversational ability and technical issues as system challenges. Privacy, dependence, and cost were major concerns. Future applications should maximize the agent's conversational ability and the system's overall usability. Our results can inform future designs of conversational agents for older adults, which need to include older adults as system co-designers to maximize usability and acceptance. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",1,1,1,0
"Cognitive flexibility training: A large-scale multimodal adaptive active-control intervention study in healthy older adults. As aging is associated with cognitive decline, particularly in the executive functions, it is essential to effectively improve cognition in older adults. Online cognitive training is currently a popular, though controversialmethod. Although some changes seempossible in older adults through training, far transfer, and longitudinal maintenance are rarely seen. Based on previous literature we created a unique, state-of-the-art intervention study by incorporating frequent sessions and flexible, novel, adaptive training tasks, along with an active control group. We created a program called TAPASS (Training Project Amsterdam Seniors and Stroke), a randomized controlled trial. Healthy older adults (60-80 y.o.) were assigned to a frequent- (FS) or infrequent switching (IS) experimental condition or to the active control group and performed 58 half-hour sessions over the course of 12 weeks. Effects on executive functioning, processing- and psychomotor speed, planning, verbal long term memory, verbal fluency, and reasoning were measured on four time points before, during and after the training. Additionally, we examined the explorative question which individual aspects added to training benefit. Besides improvements on the training, we found significant time effects on multiple transfer tasks in all three groups that likely reflected retest effects. No training-specific improvements were detected, and we did not find evidence of additional benefits of individual characteristics. Judging from these results, the therapeutic value of using commercially available training games to train the aging brain is modest, though any apparent effects should be ascribed more to expectancy and motivation than to the elements in our training protocol. Our results emphasize the importance of using parallel tests as outcome measures for transfer and including both active and passive control conditions. Further investigation into different training methods is advised, including stimulating social interaction and the use of more variable, novel, group-based yet individual-adjusted exercises. © 2017 Buitenweg, van de Ven, Prinssen, Murre and Ridderinkhof.",1,1,1,0

Given the unique needs of older adults, we opted for a participatory design approach, prototyping the system with 22 older adults through a series of design workshops in two locations. Four individuals used our resulting system over a period of two weeks. Based on their feedback and a review of design workshops, we are currently in the process of refining our interface and preparing for a larger deployment study.

"What is a sustainable retirement village? Perceptions of Australian developers. Developers are key stakeholders in delivering sustainable retirement villages. Understanding the way they perceive sustainability is of great significance in shaping the provision of sustainable living environments in this industry. This study explores village developers’ perceptions of a sustainable living environment through a comprehensive content analysis of their online descriptions of sustainability features of their villages. Thirty-nine sustainability features were identified, with the most mentioned being “care and services provision and accessibility”, “social interaction”, “secure/safe living” and “independent living”. The social sustainability of the retirement village environment was highly valued by developers, with the majority of the sustainability features relating to this feature, while environmental sustainability was largely ignored. Although there is no significant difference between the private and not-for-profit village developers regarding the numbers of sustainability features mentioned, the private village developers value “social interaction” more while the not-for-profit village developers prioritize “independent living” and “care and services provision and accessibility” the most. The research leads to a better understanding of retirement village developers’ perceptions on a sustainable living environment, which further reveals the meaning of sustainable retirement villages in Australia. All these will ultimate benefit the development of the Australian retirement village industry in general. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0,0,0,0
"Exergaming for balance training, transparent monitoring, and social inclusion of community-dwelling elderly. One of the implications of aging population is the increasing need for services for elderly people, with an emphasis on earlier diagnosis and effective interventions promoting an active and healthy aging process. To face this need, the MoveCare Project develops and field-Tests an innovative multi-Actor platform that integrates a robotic system with environmental sensors, smart objects, a virtual community and an activity center to provide assistance, transparent monitoring and activities to the elder at home. The newness of MoveCare consists in the design of a transparent monitoring and in its social and overarching nature that envisages the cooperation of multiple actors to implement a well-Accepted, personalized, and engaging platform to hinder decline in independent elderly users. This work illustrates the rationale and the implementation of transparent physical monitoring during the execution of balancetraining exergames tailored to the user performance. Different game modalities, such as playing alone, in competition, or collaboration with other elders of the virtual community will be available. Real-Time and offline indicators will be extracted and analyzed to keep track of the user's profile with the aim of preventing physical and social decline. © 2017 IEEE.",0,0,0,0
"Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study. Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",1,0,0,1
"Digital photographic practices as expressions of personhood and identity: variations across school leavers and recent retirees. Over the last two decades, digital photography has been adopted by young and old. Many young adults easily take photos, share them across multiple social networks using smartphones, and create digital identities for themselves consciously and unconsciously. Is the same true for older adults? As part of a larger mixed-methods study of online life in the UK, we considered digital photographic practices at two life transitions: leaving secondary school and retiring from work. In this paper, we report on a complex picture of different kinds of interactions with visual media online, and variation across age groups in the construction of digital identities. In doing so, we argue for a blurring of the distinctions between Chalfen’s ‘Kodak Culture’ and Miller and Edwards’ ‘Snaprs’. The camera lens often faces inwards for young adults: tagged ‘Selfies’ and images co-constructed with social network members commonly contribute to their digital identities. In contrast, retirees turn the camera’s lens outwards towards the world, not inwards to themselves. In concluding, we pay special attention to the digital social norms of co-creation of self and balancing convenience and privacy for people of varying ages, and what our findings mean for the future of photo-sharing as a form of self-expression, as today’s young adults grow old and retire. © 2017 International Visual Sociology Association.",0,0,0,0

"Measurement and visualization of face-to-face interaction among community-dwelling older adults using wearable sensors. Aim: A number of interventions have been undertaken to develop and promote social networks among community-dwelling older adults. However, it has been difficult to examine the effects of these interventions, because of problems in assessing interactions. The present study was designed to quantitatively measure and visualize face-to-face interactions among elderly participants in an exercise program. We also examined relationships among interactional variables, personality and interest in community involvement, including interactions with the local community. Methods: Older adults living in the same community were recruited to participate in an exercise program that consisted of four sessions. We collected data on face-to-face interactions of the participants by using a wearable sensor technology device. Results: Network analysis identified the communication networks of participants in the exercise program, as well as changes in these networks. Additionally, there were significant correlations between the number of people involved in face-to-face interactions and changes in both interest in community involvement and interactions with local community residents, as well as personality traits, including agreeableness. Conclusions: Social networks in the community are essential for solving problems caused by the aging society. We showed the possible applications of face-to-face interactional data for identifying core participants having many interactions, and isolated participants having only a few interactions within the community. Such data would be useful for carrying out efficient interventions for increasing participants’ involvement with their community.

"Senior, mature or single: A qualitative analysis of homepage advertisements of dating sites for older adults. In light of the growing importance of online dating sites for older adults and their potential for increased social support and leisure activities, the present study assessed the verbal contents of homepage advertisements of online dating sites. We identified dating sites for older adults through the Google web-search engine, during May 2016. All verbal information available on the homepage of the sites was used for analysis purposes. Qualitative content analysis was conducted, using open coding, followed by grouping of codes into major themes. A first theme, named, “how are older adults described?” addressed the advertised characteristics of the target population. Older adults, were portrayed in positive-neutral terms vs. negative terms. A second theme, named, “what do older adults want?” described the main purpose of each site as promoting long-term relationship or even marriage vs. companionship or flirting. Ambivalence about old age is evident in the ways older adults and dating sites are advertised. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",0,0,0,0
"Harnessing Peer Support in an Online Intervention for Older Adults with Depression. Objective This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of two methods of delivering a cognitive behaviorally informed Internet intervention for depression for adults 65 years and older. Methods Forty-seven participants were enrolled and assigned to receive one of two versions of the Internet intervention, either delivered individually (III) or with peer support (II+PS), or to a wait list control group (WLC). Primary outcomes included change in depressive symptoms from baseline to post-intervention (week 8), site use, self-reported usability, and coach time. Secondary outcomes included measures of social support and isolation and anxiety. Results Follow-up data were provided by 85.1% (40 of 47) of enrolled participants. There were significant differences in depression change across groups (F(2,37) = 3.81, p = 0.03). Greater reductions in depressive symptoms were found for the III (p = 0.02) and II+PS (p = 0.03) compared with WLC, and significantly less coach time was required in the II+PS (p = 0.003). Conclusions These results highlight the potential of cognitive-behaviorally informed Internet interventions for older adults with depression, and indicate that peer-supported programs are both acceptable and equivalent to individually delivered Internet interventions. Including peer support may be a viable and potentially more cost-effective option for disseminating online treatments for depression for older adults. © 2017 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry",1,1,1,1
"A Pilot Online Mindfulness Intervention to Decrease Caregiver Burden and Improve Psychological Well-Being. Interventions to reduce caregiver burden are of great interest as the number of informal family caregivers continues to grow. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of an online mindfulness meditation intervention for community-dwelling older adult caregivers and to evaluate its impact on quality of life, caregiver burden, and psychological well-being. A total of 40 caregivers were recruited from 2 community center support groups to participate in an 8-week online mindfulness intervention. Pre and post surveys were administered. Retention rates were high with 55% completing the post surveys and attending at least 5 out of 8 sessions. Matched pairs t test indicated that the intervention reduced caregiver burden, perceived stress, anxiety, and loneliness and improved mental well-being. Online interventions offer flexibility for caregivers regardless of their responsibilities. Future research should expand this opportunity and explore the scalability of online mindfulness interventions. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",0,1,0,0
"The role of urban green spaces in care facilities for elderly people across European cities. Urban green spaces (UGS) are increasingly acknowledged for their importance for the well-being of urban populations. However, studies are lacking the consideration of the demand and use of UGS by different population groups and connecting UGS with social infrastructure. In an era of worldwide urbanization and ageing, this European study sheds light on the role of UGS for care facilities for elderly. 126 care facilities from 17 cities in Austria, Germany, Norway, Poland, Romania and Slovenia took part in an online survey. Administrations of care facilities gave insights on the (1) importance of gardens related to care facilities for the quality of life for the seniors, (2) importance of UGS outside of care facilities for the quality of life for the seniors and (3) the consideration of natural and age-friendly designs and management of ecosystem disservices of UGS. The results emphasize not only the importance of UGS for the quality of life of seniors residing in care facilities, but also for the staff and visitors. UGS contribute to physical activities, recreation, and social interactions. The study found that in particular facilities with an own garden are highly aware of the benefits UGS provide. The study holds important lessons for UGS planning, management and design not only to focus on the quantitative supply of UGS, but also to consider age-sensitive amenities in and access to UGS of high quality for seniors. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",0,0,0,0
"Stimulating intellectual activity with adaptive environment (SMILE). As of 2016, 47.5 million people have dementia worldwide according to the World Health Organization, and it is expected that this number will nearly double every 20 years, reaching 100 million sooner than 2030. The goal of the SMILE concept is to help the elderly to live independently and to prevent/delay dementia. It should improve the quality of life of elderly by introducing healthy habits and a lifelong involvement in mentally and socially stimulating activities. It should reduce social isolation, i.e. high degree of loneliness, dissatisfaction with social contacts, and decreased social network. The focus is on prevention of gradual decline in memory function and planning ability, as well. Applying social network concepts provides easier social interaction for older people. Using stimulating and interactive environment enhances and maintains brain plasticity through social interaction. So far there are no published articles or projects that are targeted at the same goal to develop a self-care social interactive TV system as a Service, which is the aim of the SMILE concept. There are a lot of projects and papers about the relevant technologies, however not the integrated approach, which is the key innovation in this concept. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",0,0,0,0
"A Novel Integrated Architecture for Ambient Assisted Living Systems. The increase in life expectancy and the slumping birth rates across the world result in lengthening the average age of the society. Therefore, we are in need of techniques that will assist the elderly in their daily life, while preventing their social isolation. The recent developments in Ambient Intelligence and Information and Communication Technologies have facilitated a technological revolution in the field of Ambient Assisted Living. At present, there are many technologies on the market that support the independent life of older adults, requiring less assistance from family and caregivers, yet most of them offer isolated services, such as health monitoring, reminders etc, moreover none of current solutions incorporates the integration of various functionalities and user preferences or are formally analyzed for their functionality and quality-of-service attributes, a much needed endeavor in order to ensure safe mitigations of potential critical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel architectural solution that integrates necessary functions of an AAL system seamlessly, based on user preferences. To enable the first level of the architecture's analysis, we model our system in Architecture Analysis and Design Language, and carry out its simulation for analyzing the end-to-end data-flow latency, resource budgets and system safety. © 2017 IEEE.",0,0,0,0
"SNS Agency Robot for Elderly People Using External Cloud-Based Services. We propose a SNS Agency Robot that can be used for the interactive communication between elderly people and younger generation via existing Social Networking Service (SNS). This robot system has been implemented on a cloud service and a single board computer embedded in a human-type robot, which is equipped with a microphone, camera, speaker, sensors, and network access function, so that elderly people can transmit and receive information by voice via SNS without using smartphones. We employed LINE that is a proprietary application for instant communications on electronic devices such as smartphones. In LINE, we need to select a message destination address before sending messages. On the other hand, our proposed robot is basically operated by voice due to realizing the simple user interface. Therefore, we proposed a message exchange learning-type destination estimation method that enables elderly people not to express a message destination address explicitly. We developed the prototype system including the message exchange learning-type destination estimation method. Then, we confirmed the effectiveness of the message destination estimation through the demonstration experiment at the house for the elderly with the care service. © 2017 IEEE.",1,0,0,0
"Elderly people’s perceptions of using Wii sports bowling–A qualitative study. The Nintendo Wii is a gaming console with motion-sensitive controls that is making inroads into health care and rehabilitation. However, there is still limited knowledge on how elderly people perceive the use of such a product. The aim of this study was to examine how the use of the Wii Sports Bowling in an activity group was perceived by elderly people. The data consisted of observations and interviews with participants who used Wii Sports Bowling and was analysed with content analysis. The findings are described in three themes; ‘The use of the Wii Sports game’, ‘Engagement in the game’ and ‘Social interaction around the activity’. Wii Sports Bowling was described as easier to play compared to real-life bowling and was enjoyable and a social activity. The opportunity to meet the group each week was important for the participants. Playing the game resulted in signs of immersion and a flow-like state. The Wii was perceived to be easy to use, to provide a way to socialize with peers and to give opportunities to participate in activities in a new way. More studies regarding elderly people’s experiences and apprehensions regarding new technology such as gaming consoles and virtual reality are needed. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",1,1,1,0
"Cognitive benefits of online social networking for healthy older adults. Objectives: Research suggests that older adults who remain socially active and cognitively engaged have better cognitive function than those who are isolated and disengaged. This study examined the efficacy of learning and using an online social networking website, Facebook.com, as an intervention to maintain or enhance cognitive function in older adults. Method: Forty-one older adults were assigned to learn and use Facebook (n = 14) or an online diary website (active control, n = 13) for 8 weeks or placed on a waitlist (n = 14). Outcome measures included neuropsychological tests of executive functions, memory, and processing speed and self-report questionnaires about social engagement. Results: The Facebook group showed a significant increase in a composite measure of updating, an executive function factor associated with complex working memory tasks, compared to no significant change in the control groups. Other measures of cognitive function and social support showed no differential improvement in the Facebook group. Discussion: Learning and using an online social networking site may provide specific benefits for complex working memory in a group of healthy older adults. This may reflect the particular cognitive demands associated with online social networking and/or the benefits of social engagement more generally. © The Author 2016.

"What accounts for the relationship between internet use and suicidal ideation of Korean older adults? A mediation analysis. Objectives: This study sought to examine the relationship between Internet use and suicidal ideation in Korean older adults and the mediating roles of social relationships and depressive symptoms. Method: A nationally representative sample of older adults aged 50 or older (N = 6,306), from four waves of the Korean Welfare Panel Study, was used in the analyses. All analyses were conducted using generalized estimation equations, and the mediation effects of social relationship satisfaction and depression in the relationship between Internet use and suicidal ideation were calculated using the product-of-coefficients approach. Results: Internet use was linked with lower levels of suicidal ideation directly and indirectly via the protective effects of Internet use on lowering depression, which was partially mediated by the positive influence Internet use has on older adults’ social relationship satisfaction. Discussion: The results support previous theories about the relationship between social relationships, depression, and suicidal behavior and prior results about how the Internet might confer mental and social health benefits to older adults. This suggests that the Internet is an important social and health activity that contributes to lowering suicidal ideation in older adults. © The Author 2016.

"Aging in activity space: Results from smartphone-based GPS-tracking of urban seniors. Objectives: Prior research emphasizes the importance of the residential neighborhood context during later life but little attention has been afforded to other areas that older adults encounter as they move beyond their residential environments for daily activities and social interactions. This study examines the predominance of the residential context within older adults’ everyday lives. Method: We provided 60 older adults in four New York City neighborhoods with iPhones, which captured Global Positioning Systems (GPS) locations at 5-min intervals over 1 week (n = 55,561) and 17 ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) over 4 days (n = 757) to assess real-time activities. Results: Older adults in our sample spent nearly 40% of their time outside of their residential tracts and they visited 28 other tracts, on average. Exercising, shopping, socializing, and social activities were especially likely to take place outside of residential tracts. Differences in residential and nonresidential poverty exposure vary across gender, race/ethnicity, education, car ownership, and residential areas. Discussion: Measuring activity space, rather than relying on residential tracts, allows examination of the social environments that are relevant for older adults’ everyday lives. Variation in characteristics of activity spaces may be an underex-plored source of differences in health and well-being during later life. © The Author 2017.

"Information and communication technology use is related to higher well-being among the oldest-old. Objectives: Older adults often prioritize socially meaningful goals over informational goals. Thus, we predicted that using information and communication technology (ICT) in service of socially meaningful versus informational goals relates to higher well-being among the oldest-old. Method: We surveyed 445 adults aged 80+ (mean = 84, range = 80–93; 64% female; 26% non-White) online or via telephone. Participants reported motivations for ICT use (connect with others, learn new information) and rated their psychological and physical well-being (i.e., life satisfaction, loneliness, goal attainment, subjective health, functional limitations). We conducted regression and mediation analyses to test our hypothesis. Results: Participants used ICT more to connect with friends/family (M = 3.66, SD = 1.28) than to learn information (M = 2.61, SD = 1.44), p < .001. Overall, ICT use predicted higher well-being across outcomes, ps ≤ .008. Motivations for use differentially mediated these effects: Social motivations mediated the relationships between ICT use and psychological well-being, whereas informational motivations mediated the relationships between ICT use and physical well-being. Discussion: Older adults aged 80+ use ICT less than other generations, but may have much to gain. Using social versus informational technologies may enhance multiple aspects of well-being in different ways during very late life. Highlighting such benefits may increase ICT adoption among the oldest-old. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.

"Using a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment protocol with community dwelling older African Americans. Objectives: Little is known about the feasibility of smartphone-based Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) approaches to collect psychosocial data from older populations, especially disadvantaged older populations. In response to this gap, this report provides evidence of the feasibility and utility of a smartphone-based EMA approach for real-time assessment with older African Americans. In addition, we share lessons learned about how to improve utility. Methods: Ninety-seven older African Americans ages 55 and older (range: 55–95 years) used an Android smartphone loaded with an EMA application to provide data about their everyday activities and stress four times per day for seven consecutive days. Results: Exit interviews early in the study suggested enhancements to the EMA interface. Adherence was demonstrated with response completion rates of 92–98% on EMA measures and no participant attrition based on the EMA protocol. Discussion: Our findings suggest using a smartphone-based EMA approach for data collection is feasible and has utility with older African Americans. We most likely enhanced adherence by testing, training, monitoring, and adapting the EMA protocol using input from older adults early in the EMA design process. © The Author 2017.

"The digital divide experienced by older consumers in smart environments. The continuing transition of the Internet from wired to mobile has facilitated changes in Internet use. By focusing on older consumers as a potentially disadvantaged group, this study examines whether smart environments have the potential to bridge the digital divide. Data were derived from an analysis of the 2013 South Korean Information Divide data set (n = 2386 for those 60 years and older; n = 5841 for those under 60 years). The existence of a digital divide in the smart environment was verified by comparing younger and older South Koreans; this showed that continuing consumer education is needed to enhance older people's experience and skills regarding information and in its use of communication technology. The digital divide was measured based on three aspects: accessibility, competence, and usage. In smart environments, gaps in accessibility and competence between the age groups increased whereas the gap in information usage decreased. Compared with the personal computer-based environment, members of both groups in the smart environment exhibited increased usage levels with regard to social relationship services, while the gap between the groups with regard to use of convenience services was reduced. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",1,0,0,0
"Rural actresses or rural workers? The theater and the facade to obtain special rural retirement [Atrizes da roça ou trabalhadoras rurais? O teatro e a fachada para obtenção da aposentadoria especial rural]. This article concerns about gender inequalities in the judicial discourse and practices under special federal courts. The trial of the lawsuits of rural special retirement is mainly held by special federal courts (Juizados Especiais Federais - JEFs). For the demarcation of the cases, the judges must decide whether the plaintiff is a special rural insured, a task that involves a lot of legal concepts and subjective interpretations in the microcosm of judicial practice. Based on Erving Goffman teatrology, interviews, hearings and rulings of Paraíba JEFs were analyzed for gender inequalities in the discourse of the actors involved in social interaction. Particularly, he understandings given to labor and rural individually or in a household system working were studied. It was observed that the ideas of “light” work and “heavy” work were used as “technologies of gender” for classifying and regulating who is the special rural insured, inserting it in a familiar and predictable social facade, which, on the other hand, is very restricted and may consequently generate potential injustices. © 2017, Universidade de Brasilia.

"The experiences of working carers of older people regarding access to a web-based family care support network offered by a municipality. Policy makers in Sweden and other European Member States pay increasing attention as to how best support working carers; carers juggling providing unpaid family care for older family members while performing paid work. Exploring perceived benefits and challenges with web-based information and communication technologies as a means of supporting working carers' in their caregiving role, this paper draws on findings from a qualitative study. The study aimed to describe working carers' experiences of having access to the web-based family care support network ‘A good place' (AGP) provided by the municipality to support those caring for an older family member. Content analysis of interviews with nine working carers revealed three themes: A support hub, connections to peers, personnel and knowledge; Experiencing ICT support as relevant in changing life circumstances; and Upholding one's personal firewall. Findings indicate that the web-based family care support network AGP is an accessible, complementary means of support. Utilising support while balancing caregiving, work obligations and responsibilities was made easier with access to AGP; enabling working carers to access information, psychosocial support and learning opportunities. In particular, it provided channels for carers to share experiences with others, to be informed, and to gain insights into medical and care issues. This reinforced working carers' sense of competence, helping them meet caregiving demands and see positive aspects in their situation. Carers' low levels of digital skills and anxieties about using computer-based support were barriers to utilising web-based support and could lead to deprioritising of this support. However, to help carers overcome these barriers and to better match web-based support to working carers' preferences and situations, web-based support must be introduced in a timely manner and must more accurately meet each working carer's unique caregiving needs. © 2016 Nordic College of Caring Science",0,0,0,0
"Within-Gender Differences in Medical Decision Making Among Male Carriers of the BRCA Genetic Mutation for Hereditary Breast Cancer. An intersectional approach was used to understand sex/gender differences in men’s health decisions with regard to hereditary breast cancer (BRCA). A sequential explanatory mixed method design was employed consisting of an online survey with a convenience sample of 101 men who tested positive for the breast cancer mutation following up with an in-depth interview with a subsample of 26 males who participated in the survey. The survey results revealed that 70.3% (n = 45) considered “Family Risk” as the primary reason for getting BRCA tested; 21.9% (n = 14) considered “Medical Considerations,” and 7.8% (n = 5) considered “Social Support” as their primary reason. Male participants who were 50 years old or younger or who did not have children were more likely to consider medical reasons as the primary reason to get tested. In terms of self-concept, younger men were more stigmatized than their older counterparts; married men felt a greater loss of control with regard to their BRCA-positive mutation diagnosis than single men; and professional men as a whole felt more vulnerable to the negative influences of the disease than those who had already retired. Regression analysis results indicated that negative self-concept was strongly related to sampled males’ BRCA involvement 6 months after testing. Applying an intersectional approach to health care, decision-making outcomes among BRCA-positive mutation males provides an important lens for ascertaining the within-sex/gender demographic and psychosocial factors that affect the diversity of men’s pretesting and posttesting medical decisions. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",0,0,0,0
"Palliative care expectations and needs: Survey among healthcare personnel of a geriatric hospital [Attentes et besoins en soins palliatifs : enquête auprès des soignants d'un hôpital gériatrique]. Purpose of the study In geriatric wards, feelings of loneliness, isolation and medical reluctance can be perceived by mobile palliative care team staff. In this context, a survey has been conducted to assess nurses and caregivers’ palliative care training, needs and expectations. Methods An anonymous survey has been conducted in June 2015, including the nurses and all the caregivers of a 379-bed residential facility for the elderly requiring full time care and geriatric long time care unit. Dr-Chastaingt hospital is a public institution attached to Limoges university hospital (France). A questionnaire was addressed to review the local palliative context, the needs of heathcare personnels and their expectations. Results and discussion Ninety-four questionnaires were returned, with four white sheets and 90 filled forms. The main reasons for seeking advice from the palliative care team are the patient and his pain and caregivers suffering and at the third place family support. Pain management and end of life remain the main expectations of caregivers both for technical assistance, training and support. These results show a questioning on the end of life, a need for modeling in order to identify the tipping point between healing and terminal care. They also show the need to build a common space for dialogue between physicians, nurses, caregivers, patient and family in order to act together instead of interacting on a confrontational or suspicious way. The cooperation with the palliative care team is described both by the form and mode. The cooperation is based on meetings and practical cooperation (care, prescriptions, visits). Pain and autonomy assessments are regular but not systematic in geriatrics. The palliative care team trigger tools are not known (Pallia-10, Palliative Performans Scale). Conclusion Despite all the efforts, we have yet to build a collaborative network on the basis of a common palliative culture. The long-term goal is to promote the integration of a vision of palliative care as part of the course and the project of life of the elderly. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS",0,0,0,1

Objectives: To conduct an 8-year follow-up of the National Elder Mistreatment Study (NEMS) and specify risk ratios for negative outcomes of elder abuse, including DSM-5 defined depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and poor self-reported health. Methods: Attempts were made to re-contact, via Computer Assisted Telephone Interview, all 752 NEMS participants who reported mistreatment since age 60 at Wave I, as well as a randomly selected sample of non-mistreated NEMS participants Results: 183 NEMS Wave I elder abuse victims and 591 non-victims provided data. In bivariate analyses, elder mistreatment 8 years earlier increased risk of negative outcomes by 200–700%. However, multivariate analyses revealed that Current (Wave II) social support was highly protective against most negative outcomes (excepting PTSD), and even appeared to nullify effects of mistreatment on GAD and poor self-reported health. Conclusions: Outcomes of elder mistreatment have not been studied prospectively in a national sample. The NEMS 8-year follow-up findings indicate a strong relationship between elder mistreatment at Wave I and negative emotional and physical health 8 years later. Fortunately, current (Wave II) social support appears to be both consistently and powerfully protective against most negative outcomes. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",1,0,0,1
"Adapting a Psychosocial Intervention for Smartphone Delivery to Middle-Aged and Older Adults with Serious Mental Illness. Objective To describe the process of adapting an integrated medical and psychiatric self-management intervention to a smartphone application for middle-aged and older adults with serious mental illness using an adaptive systems engineering framework and user-centered design. Methods First, we determined the technical abilities and needs of middle-aged and older adults with serious mental illnesses using smartphones. Then, we developed smartphone content through principles of user-centered design and modified an existing smartphone platform. Finally, we conducted a usability test using “think aloud” and verbal probing. Results We adapted a psychosocial self-management intervention to a smartphone application and tested its usability. Ten participants (mean age: 55.3 years, SD: 6.2 years) with serious mental illness and comorbid chronic health conditions reported a high level of usability and satisfaction with the smartphone application. Conclusions Middle-aged and older adults with serious mental illness and limited technical abilities were able to participate in a process involving user-centered design and adaptation of a self-management intervention to be delivered by a smartphone. High usability ratings suggest that middle-aged and older adults with serious mental illness have the potential to use tailored smartphone interventions. Future research is indicated to establish effectiveness and to determine the type and intensity of clinical support needed to successfully implement smartphone applications as a component of community-based services for older adults with psychiatric and medical conditions. © 2017 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry",0,0,0,1
"Determinants of user acceptance of a specific social platform for older adults: An empirical examination of user interface characteristics and behavioral intention. The use of the Internet and social applications has many benefits for the elderly, but numerous investigations have shown that the elderly do not perceive online social networks as a friendly social environment. Therefore, TreeIt, a social application specifically designed for the elderly, was developed for this study. In the TreeIt application, seven mechanisms promoting social interaction were designed to allow older adults to use social networking sites (SNSs) to increase social connection, maintain the intensity of social connections and strengthen social experience. This study’s main objective was to investigate how user interface design affects older people’s intention and attitude related to using SNSs. Fourteen user interface evaluation heuristics proposed by Zhang et al. were adopted as the criteria to assess user interface usability and further grouped into three categories: system support, user interface design and navigation. The technology acceptance model was adopted to assess older people’s intention and attitude related to using SNSs. One hundred and one elderly persons were enrolled in this study as subjects, and the results showed that all of the hypotheses proposed in this study were valid: system support and perceived usefulness had a significant effect on behavioral intention; user interface design and perceived ease of use were positively correlated with perceived usefulness; and navigation exerted an influence on perceived ease of use. The results of this study are valuable for the future development of social applications for the elderly. © 2017 Tsai et al.

"Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) and Socio-Emotional Wellbeing. Expanding and building on our previous study, the current study mainly explored the degree to which older adults' social interactions in Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) are associated with four socio-emotional factors. A total of 222 older World of Warcraft players, recruited online, completed a Web questionnaire. Consistent with the findings of the previous study, older adults' socio-emotional wellbeing was associated with the quality of guild play and enjoyment of relationship. Socio-emotional wellbeing was not associated with the amount of gameplay, intensity of interaction, network level and social motivation for playing MMORPGs. In addition, the findings also indicated that a large number of older adults developed meaningful online relationships with their game friends, but that it would be difficult for them to integrate these online friends into their ‘real' lives. © 2017",1,0,0,0
"Using Internet technologies in rural communities to access services: The views of older people and service providers. Older people in rural communities increasingly rely on the Internet to access essential health, finance, education, and other social services. However, their abilities to participate in the online service system are often undermined by a continuing ‘digital divide’. This divide may be exacerbated by the strategies of service providers who fail to recognise and respond to the needs of older rural clients. This paper is based on a case study in Clare, a small rural town in South Australia, and examines the experiences of older residents and local service providers in trying to engage online for digital service delivery. Drawing on two sets of in-depth interviews, the study uses a mix of thematic content analysis and social network analysis to identify the nature and extent of digital interactions between older people and service providers, and the enablers and challenges for online service engagement. Older participants demonstrated considerable interest in learning how to use the Internet for accessing particular services, with social support networks and third party facilitators being crucial enablers. Service providers’ ambitions to engage with older people online appeared more limited as a result of entrenched stereotypes of older non-users, a lack of internal digital skills, as well as organisational and funding constraints. The case study findings emphasise the importance of balancing the views of older people and service providers in the design of online engagement strategies. These insights are critical for improving online service delivery in rural communities affected by an increasing withdrawal of physical services. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",1,0,0,0
"The Psychosocial Implications of Managing Work and Family Caregiving Roles: Gender Differences Among Information Technology Professionals. An increasing number of adults, both men and women, are simultaneously managing work and family caregiving roles. Guided by the stress process model, we investigate whether 823 employees occupying diverse family caregiving roles (child caregiving only, elder caregiving only, and both child caregiving and elder caregiving, or “sandwiched” caregiving) and their noncaregiving counterparts in the information technology division of a white-collar organization differ on several indicators of psychosocial stress along with gender differences in stress exposure. Compared with noncaregivers, child caregivers reported more perceived stress and partner strain whereas elder caregivers reported greater perceived stress and psychological distress. With the exception of work-to-family conflict, sandwiched caregivers reported poorer overall psychosocial functioning. Additionally, sandwiched women reported more family-to-work conflict and less partner support than their male counterparts. Further research on the implications of combining a white-collar employment role with different family caregiving roles is warranted. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",0,0,0,0
"Research Priorities in Subspecialty Palliative Care: Policy Initiatives. Palliative care demonstrably improves quality of life for the seriously ill in a manner that averts preventable health crises and their associated costs. Because of these outcomes, palliative care is now broadening its reach beyond hospitals, and hospice care for those near death, to patients and their families living in the community with chronic multimorbidities that have uncertain or long expected survival. In this article, we address research needed to enable policies supportive of palliative care access and quality, including changes in regulatory, accreditation, financing, and training approaches in the purview of policy makers. Mr. K. is an 86-year-old male with multimorbidities, including severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulation therapy. He fell in his mobile home and was unable to reach the telephone to call for help. Six hours later, his neighbor found him lying on the bedroom floor in pain and confused, and called 911. On examination, he was found to have a cold blue foot complicated by a large hematoma. Th vascular surgery service was consulted to evaluate Mr. K. for revascularization or amputation. Although Mr. K. had several risk factors complicating his candidacy for general anesthesia, the team thought the benefits of surgery would outweigh the risks. Mr. K's daughter agreed to surgery telling her father ""the doctors know best."" Mr. K. replied ""I just want to be out of pain."" Six months later, Mr. K. remains in a skilled nursing facility due to post-op complications, including pneumonia, worsened confusion, and the inability to recover to enough function to live safely at home. He now suffers from depression, cognitive deficits, and social isolation. His daughter has had to take on a second job because she is struggling to pay for his continued long-term care, which costs $6000 per month. Money she had saved for her own retirement and her daughter's college tuition is already gone. In retrospect, she realizes the surgical team did not discuss the possibility of his survival with chronic debility and long-term functional dependency, nor the fact that Medicare would not pay for the care he now requires. © 2017 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",0,0,0,0
"Age-old care and support practices in Southern Africa functioning robustly as sophisticated social technology interventions. High-need contexts, such as those in postcolonial Southern Africa, require interventions that provide psychosocial and socioeconomic care and support. This comparative case study uses the lens of indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) to supplement predominantly Western knowledge of care and support interventions. Participatory reflection and action (PRA) were used in 7 conveniently selected Southern African regions reflective of bounded systems with high adversity and likely to portray indigenous belief systems on a regional basis (n = 430; elders = 240; youth = 190; men = 150 and women = 280). Interactive PRA sessions, focusing on generating narratives about traditional care and support strategies, were recorded and analyzed. It emerged that the IKS care and support interventions still being practised are fundamentally relational and pragmatic pathways of resource management, and include reciprocal donations, shared savings in societies, and partnerships and borrowing/lending. Rather than being outdated vestiges of previous times, these age-old structures continue to function as robust and sophisticated social technologies of care and support. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0,0,0,0
"Multi-objective group organization methods in online elderly watching system of local community. In recent years, caring for the elderly has emerged as a significant problem, and the number of elderly people living alone has also been on the rise. Against this backdrop, the authors propose a network for watching over the elderly in local communities. In this network, a group to watch over an elderly person is designed in a local community, and the watchers communicate with the elderly through messages over Online Social Networking platforms. Since several people in a group watch the elderly in this network, careful monitoring of the elderly and a reduction in the mental and physical burdens on watchers are achieved. The groups are organized per elderly person by the proposed method inspired by some Meta-Heuristic Algorithms so that the multi-objective requirements to each group, to quickly respond emergent unhealthy states of the elderly, and to notice any kinds of signs and symptoms proactively, are satisfied. Moreover, constraints to alleviate the watchers' burden are also applied as our original contribution. © 2017 IEEE.",1,0,0,0

"Digital technologies - Apps - and the cognitive skills of older adults: Results of an investigation at USALBI (Universidade Senior Albicastrense) [As tecnologias digitais - Apps - e as competências cognitivas dos adultos idosos Resultados de uma investigação na USALBI (Universidade Senior Albicastrense)]. In recent decades, societies have endured a major challenge: the aging of the population. The main reasons may be related to the decline in fertility rates, increased life expectancy, improved healthcare and the incorporation of healthier living habits, providing conditions for active aging. Active aging is a theme addressed by professionals who more directly that are related to the aging process. In this context, it is important to analyze and promote actions with the elderly population for this can be an integral and active part of the digital society, because increasingly the exercise of civic rights and duties to be carried out through digital platforms. At present, the digital society implies that all citizens are equipped with digital skills, in this particular case, given that the elderly population is referred to as computer exclusion population, it is urgent to create conditions to promote their digital inclusion that will enable them to true social inclusion thus providing active aging. Given the physiological and cognitive decline associated with aging is important to promote initiatives to prevent situations that could increase dementia among the elderly. In particular, there are already a number of digital applications (APPs) that aim to stimulation and cognitive training. In this research, we were used APPs in this area (Peak and Neuronation) which involved a sample of 18 seniors who attended USALBI (Universidade Sénior Albicastrense). This Project Workseeks to ascertain whether the use of digital applications (APPs) Peak & Neuronation can contribute to active aging of the elderly, with regard to cognitive training that they provide. In addition to the 18 elderlies, as students of computer course USALBI, where it made a non-participant observation in 12 practice sessions of APPs Peak & Neuronation and applied questionnaire surveys and these old, was also involved one professional of Social Gerontology and an expert in the field of ICT through semi-structured interviews to ascertain their views concerning digital applications involved in the study. After the triangulation of data can be said that the views expressed were agreed regarding the added value of the APPs Peak & Neuronation in cognitive training where it involved the memory valences; language; mental agility; reasoning; speed; flexibility; coordination; attention; focus; concentration; perception; troubles hooting; mental calculations; emotion and will power. From the analysis of the data, it was found that the APPs can be referred to as digital tools in the cognitive training of older people. © 2017 AISTI.",1,1,1,0
"Social interactions of the elderly: Mapping pedagogical strategies for Distance [Interações sociais de idosos: mapeamento de estratégias pedagógicas para Educação a Distância]. This research aims to map out possible pedagogical strategies for improve the social relations of elderly in distance courses. Around the world are increasing the number of the old-aged people, at the same time the interest in courses of continued education. The distance education is the one of viable ways for the elders, because allow an increase of best quality of life based in their interests and needs. However, a lack of studies about this subject and who contemplate the aged public is observed, particularly in the social interactions. Therefore, this research mapped possible pedagogical strategies for the distance education that can be adopted with elderly toward to maximize the social relations. The used methodology was case of study qualitative and quantitative. For the data collect, it was used a semi-structured questionnaire, the reports of elderly and participant observation. The participants were 16 elderly aged over 60 years who entered in course of digital inclusion. Through the course, the elderly participated, at distance, in a workshop about literary memories. In this process, it was possible to map pedagogical strategies that allowed greater social interaction among participants. In these mapped strategies, it is possible to observe the utilization of: synchronous and asynchronous tools of the virtual learning environment, the adoption of communication resources through mobile devices, such as WhatsApp, the necessity of face meetings, to remedy potential difficulties in the use of technological resources, the utilization of explanatory tutorials about the communication tools, the teacher intervention and mediation, and others.

"The urgency of lifelong learning: A study on the learning of information and communication technologies in populations 50+ [A premência na formação ao longo da vida: Um estudo sobre a aprendizagem das Tecnologias da Informação e da Comunicação em populações 50+]. This article aims to address a doctoral research carried out in the senior universities of the district of Castelo Branco in the academic year 2013/2014, whose main objective was to identify the sociocultural factors that influence and condition the option to learn ICT and to know the impacts of this learning on well-being (mental and social) throughout the aging process. Data were collected at 5 senior universities in this district through a questionnaire survey involving 374 citizens (50+ years old) and from interviews to 5 Directors, 5 ICT Teachers and 10 Participants who have already attended ICT training in their respective universities. The results allowed us to verify that the need for communication, the fight against isolation are the main sociocultural factors that influenced the learning of ICT in these participants. The exercise of memory and intellectual skills, participation and inclusion in the digital society and the reduction of loneliness were the most evident impacts on the 'mental well-being' and 'social well-being'. © 2017 AISTI.",0,0,0,0
"EHealthPortal: A social support hub for the active living of the elderly. The absolute and relative increases in the number of elderly are evident worldwide, from the most developed countries to the lowestincome regions. The fast demographic transition poses great challenges to the healthcare system and introduces a significant burden to the elderly and their family. To meet the unprecedented challenges of global aging, various aging-in-place (AIP) solutions have been proposed to enable the elderly to live in their own home and community safely, independently and comfortably. Elderly need support in various aspects, such as physical, cognitive, emotional, and social, in their daily life. However, most existing AIP solutions provide support in one or two aspects only and many focus on anomaly detection rather than deliver care or companionship. To better facilitate eldercare at home, we propose eHealthPortal, which is a social support hub for the active living of the elderly. By crowdsourcing help and support from the users' family and friends, caregivers, and doctors, eHealthPortal cares for the wellness of the elderly in all the four aforementioned key aspects. As a novel feature of the system, eHealthPortal is supported by a group of virtual and robotic agents for providing reliable sensing in unobtrusive ways seamlessly, tender caring in a holistic manner proactively, and actual companionship in natural forms constantly. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",0,0,0,0
"Multimodal Interface for Elderly People. With the continuous ageing of the population, the demand for different healthcare services is increasing at a fast pace. At the same time, the number of caregivers is limited and the cost of well-being is increasing. Therefore, there is a recognized need for technologies that assist elderly people in their daily activities and ensure their safety along with their social integration while maintaining a higher degree of independence. One important aspect in the development of such technologies is their easy acceptance by elderly users. Traditional human-machine interfaces have always represented a barrier for the acceptance of new devices by non-technical people in general and by elderly or people with special needs in particular. In this paper, we propose a multimodal interface designed to match the requirements of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems and to fulfill the needs of elderly people who are the main users of this interface. The interface is multilingual, it supports two languages (English and Romanian) and it can process both speech and gesture commands. The interface is developed using HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3 and integrates Google Speech Service along with other services. It is able to adapt itself to any screen size and to work flawlessly across different platforms. The interface was developed and tested within the 'Artificial intelligent ecosystem for self-management and sustainable quality of life in AAL' (CAMI) project. Both the interface and the results of laboratory tests are presented in this paper. © 2017 IEEE.",1,0,0,0
"A Prescription for Internet Access: Appealing to Middle-Aged and Older Racial and Ethnic Minorities Through Social Network Sites to Combat Colorectal Cancer. The popularity and usage of social media networks or SNS (social networking sites) among American Internet users age 50 and over doubled between 2009 and 2010 and has steadily climbed. Part of this increased access may be the result of older adults who are living with a chronic disease and are reaching out for online support. Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk is among those concerns, particularly among middle-age and older minority populations where disparities exist. This exploratory study investigates information seeking behavior related to cancer factors (e.g. testing for colon cancer, cancer fatalism) and current social media usage among racial and ethnic minority groups (African American and Latinos) and Whites age 50 and older. The secondary data from the 2012 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) was analyzed to compare these populations. Results show that African Americans and Latinos were only slightly more likely to use social network sites to seek out cancer information compared to Whites. However, Whites were more likely to use the Internet to seek health information compared to African Americans and Latinos. In this sample, Whites were also more likely to be informed by a physician about CRC testing (p <.01). Whites were also more fatalistic about CRC (p<.001) and more likely to have self-reported receiving a positive diagnosis (p <.001). Implications of this study suggest that use of both traditional health information sources (physician) and the Internet (social media networks, Internet sites) have increased among older Americans and can serve as critical channels for cancer information and education. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",0,0,0,0
"Community Priorities for Healthy Eating in Older Adults. Community planners such as policymakers and health care and nutrition service providers can create an “age-friendly” environment to support healthy eating in older residents by addressing the highest priorities that enable older adults to improve their dietary intake through different food-related community settings. To identify and prioritize these factors that facilitate behavioral change (enablers) and behavioral settings important for older adult nutrition based on the social ecological model, nutrition and aging professionals (n = 30) from two rural (West Virginia, Iowa) and two urban (Massachusetts, New York) city/county regions (communities) participated in an online or live focus group discussion and completed an analytic hierarchy process survey online. Overall, the most important perceived enablers were accessibility and cost, followed by transportation and social support, but their relative importance varied by community. Participants from all communities considered congregate meal sites and food banks among the most important behavioral settings. Participants from most communities considered food stores to be important and also highlighted other settings unique to the area, such as senior housing, neighborhood, and farmers’ markets. By targeting interventions to address the most notable enablers and behavioral settings specific to their community, planning groups can enhance their older residents’ ability to achieve optimal nutritional health. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",0,0,0,0
"Connected seniors: how older adults in East York exchange social support online and offline. How do older adults mobilize social support, with and without digital media? To investigate this, we focus on older adults 65+ residing in the Toronto locality of East York, using 42 interviews lasting about 90 minutes done in 2013–2014. We find that digital media help in mobilizing social support as well as maintaining and strengthening existing relationships with geographically near and distant contacts. This is especially important for those individuals (and their network members) who have limited mobility. Once older adults start using digital media, they become routinely incorporated into their lives, used in conjunction with the telephone to maintain existing relationships but not to develop new ones. Contradicting fears that digital media are inadequate for meaningful relational contact, we found that these older adults considered social support exchanged via digital media to be real support that cannot be dismissed as token. Older adults especially used and valued digital media for companionship. They also used them for coordination, maintaining ties, and casual conversations. Email was used more with friends than relatives; some Skype was used with close family ties. Our research suggests that policy efforts need to emphasize the strengthening of existing networks rather than the establishment of interventions that are outside of older adults’ existing ties. Our findings also show that learning how to master technology is in itself a form of social support that provides opportunities to strengthen the networks of older adults. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",1,0,0,0

"Facial age estimation with age difference. Age estimation based on the human face remains a significant problem in computer vision and pattern recognition. In order to estimate an accurate age or age group of a facial image, most of the existing algorithms require a huge face data set attached with age labels. This imposes a constraint on the utilization of the immensely unlabeled or weakly labeled training data, e.g., the huge amount of human photos in the social networks. These images may provide no age label, but it is easy to derive the age difference for an image pair of the same person. To improve the age estimation accuracy, we propose a novel learning scheme to take advantage of these weakly labeled data through the deep convolutional neural networks. For each image pair, Kullback-Leibler divergence is employed to embed the age difference information. The entropy loss and the cross entropy loss are adaptively applied on each image to make the distribution exhibit a single peak value. The combination of these losses is designed to drive the neural network to understand the age gradually from only the age difference information. We also contribute a data set, including more than 100 000 face images attached with their taken dates. Each image is both labeled with the timestamp and people identity. Experimental results on two aging face databases show the advantages of the proposed age difference learning system, and the state-of-the-art performance is gained. © 2016 IEEE.",0,0,0,0
"Elderly travel frequencies and transport mode choices in Greater Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Demographic ageing is a key societal challenge in Europe as well as in many other western and non-western societies. A crucial dimension concerns elderly daily mobility patterns. While still partaking fewer and shorter trips than younger generations, today’s elderly have been found increasingly (auto)mobile. Although the elderly benefit from the independence, freedom of movement, and social inclusion, concerns may rise regarding the environmental and accessibility impacts of this induced mobility. The present study adds to the expanding literature on elderly mobility, an integrated analysis of the effects of socio-demographic, health, trip, spatial and weather attributes on elderly mobility. Utilizing travel diary data for Greater Rotterdam, The Netherlands, trip frequencies and transport mode choices of the elderly are analysed by means of zero-inflated negative binomial models as well as multinomial logit regression models, and contrasted to the non-elderly subpopulation to explore (dis)similarities. While the results show common determinants, the models also highlight important differences in the magnitude of the estimated coefficients and factors only influencing transport patterns for the elderly. Embedded in the context of an aging population, the empirical findings assist policy-makers and planners in several respects: For transportation plans and programs it is critical to recognize mobility needs of the elderly. As the seniors are becoming increasingly automobile, the results call for strategies to encourage older people to use more physically active and environmentally friendly transport modes such as public transport, walking and cycling. © 2016, The Author(s).",1,0,0,0
"The cognitive mobile games for older adults-A Chinese user experience study. Cognitive self-rehabilitation lacks updated means and tools. This paper provides a synopsis of novel cognitive recreation game tools, an analysis of their user feedback, as well as potential new ideas for game developers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attitudes and user experiences of Chinese elderly people on mobile memory rehabilitation games originally developed in Finland, Europe. Mobile games that require cognitive skills were tested with a test group in a Chinese elderly care home. User feedback was collected by interviews and observations in the game event. The most noteworthy finding was the positive user experience both of the elderly and the nursing staff and the experience of the games being cognitively stimulating. Games also seemed to provide potential for self-rehabilitation and to support social interaction. Also some special characteristics related to the Chinese culture were found in the game trial, although the experiences were surprisingly similar compared to original Finnish trials despite the cultural differences of Finland and China. The results are an encouragement for conducting further testing (on a larger test group, over a longer time) and continuing with the game development for cognitively impaired older adults. These results also encourage further development and testing of welfare technology applications in different cultural environments. © 2017 IEEE.",1,0,0,0
"Human Robot Engagement and Acceptability in Residential Aged Care. People with dementia often suffer the limitation in their ability to communicate and express themselves clearly, consequently spend most of their time alone, and are not engaged in social activity as before. The prolonged lack of engagement has contributed to a variety of negative health effects. The research on engagement and acceptability of people with dementia using assistive technology such as social robots can be useful to provide potential solutions and sustainability. Thus, this article focuses on the service design and the effectiveness of the engagement and acceptability while interacting with a social robot named Matilda being trialed from 2010 until 2013 with 115 participants in Australian residential aged care facilities. Combining the most updated engagement assessment method and the robot acceptance model as the methodology, the findings of this study indicate there is a statistically significant improvement in emotional, visual, and behavioral engagement of older people with social robots over the years. The post-trial survey has also verified their acceptance in the interaction with social robots. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1,1,1,0
"Successful aging in community seniors and stroke survivors: current and future strategies. There is growing evidence to suggest that aging is accompanied by enhancement in psychosocial well-being, despite age-related declines in physical and cognitive functioning. A small but growing body of research has reported on positive trajectories of well-being, and its determinants, among community-dwelling seniors as well as in people with specific diseases such as stroke. Current strategies for promoting successful aging include physical, cognitive and social activities, healthy lifestyle, social support, and positive traits such as resilience and optimism. These strategies have typically been employed in samples without serious illnesses, but an emerging body of evidence suggests that they are as relevant in cohorts with neurologic and other diseases. Future strategies will include those that work at the community level and not just at individual level, and will focus on use of technology as well as group interventions to enhance resilience and building age-friendly communities. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0,0,0,0
"Walk the Talk: Characterizing Mobility in Older Adults Living on Low Income. We provide an in-depth description of the mobility (capacity and enacted function, i.e., physical activity and travel behaviour) of community-dwelling older adults of low socioeconomic status. Participants [n = 161, mean age (range) = 74 (65-96) years] completed interviewer-administered questionnaires and objective measures of mobility. Our findings did not generally indicate that older adults of low socioeconomic status have a reduced capacity to be mobile. Participants presented with positive profiles across physical, psychosocial, and social environment domains that influence the capacity to be mobile. They also made a high proportion of trips by foot, although these did not together serve to meet physical activity guidelines for most. We challenge future researchers to focus on innovative strategies to recruit this difficult-to-access population, to consider the influence of socioeconomic status across the lifespan, and the role of behaviour-driven agency when investigating the association between the person, environment, and older adult mobility. © 2017 Canadian Association on Gerontology.",1,0,0,0
"Morning self-Efficacy predicts physical activity throughout the day in knee osteoarthritis. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the within-day and cross-day prospective effects of knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients' self-efficacy to engage in physical activity despite the pain on their subsequent physical activity assessed objectively in their natural environment. Method: Over 22 days, 135 older adults with knee OA reported their morning self-efficacy for being physically active throughout the day using a handheld computer and wore an accelerometer to measure moderate activity and steps. Results: Morning self-efficacy had a significant positive effect on steps and moderate-intensity activity throughout that day, above and beyond the effects of demographic background and other psychosocial factors as well as spouses' support and social control. The lagged effect of morning self-efficacy on the next day's physical activity and the reciprocal lagged effect of physical activity on the next day's self-efficacy were not significant. Positive between-person effects of self-efficacy on physical activity were found. Conclusions: Future research should aim to better understand the mechanisms underlying fluctuations in patients' daily self-efficacy, and target patients' daily self-efficacy as a modifiable psychological mechanism for promoting physical activity. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",1,0,0,1
"Cognitive and psychosocial function in retired professional hockey players. Background and Objective The relationship between repeated concussions and neurodegenerative disease has received significant attention, particularly research in postmortem samples. Our objective was to characterise retired professional ice hockey players' cognitive and psychosocial functioning in relation to concussion exposure and apolipoprotein μ 4 status. Methods Alumni athletes (N=33, aged 34-71â €..years) and an age-matched sample of comparison participants (N=18) were administered measures of cognitive function and questionnaires concerning psychosocial and psychiatric functioning. Results No significant group differences were found on neuropsychological measures of speeded attention, verbal memory or visuospatial functions, nor were significant differences observed on computerised measures of response speed, inhibitory control and visuospatial problem solving. Reliable group differences in cognitive performance were observed on tests of executive and intellectual function; performance on these measures was associated with concussion exposure. Group differences were observed for cognitive, affective and behavioural impairment on psychosocial questionnaires and psychiatric diagnoses. There was no evidence of differential effects associated with age in the alumni athletes. Possession of an apolipoprotein 4 allele was associated with increased endorsement of psychiatric complaints, but not with objective cognitive performance. Conclusions We found only subtle objective cognitive impairment in alumni athletes in the context of high subjective complaints and psychiatric impairment. Apolipoprotein 4 status related to psychiatric, but not cognitive status. These findings provide benchmarks for the degree of cognitive and behavioural impairment in retired professional athletes and a point of comparison for future neuroimaging and longitudinal studies. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

"Towards an integrated robotics architecture for social inclusion – The RAPP paradigm. Scientific breakthroughs have led to an increase in life expectancy, to the point where senior citizens comprise an ever increasing percentage of the general population. In this direction, the EU funded RAPP project “Robotic Applications for Delivering Smart User Empowering Applications” introduces socially interactive robots that will not only physically assist, but also serve as a companion to senior citizens. The proposed RAPP framework has been designed aiming towards a cloud-based integrated approach that enables robotic devices to seamlessly deploy robotic applications, relieving the actual robots from computational burdens. The Robotic Applications (RApps) developed according to the RAPP paradigm will empower consumer social robots, allowing them to adapt to versatile situations and materialize complex behaviors and scenarios. The RAPP pilot cases involve the development of RApps for the NAO humanoid robot and the ANG-MED rollator targeting senior citizens that (a) are technology illiterate, (b) have been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or (c) are in the process of hip fracture rehabilitation. Initial results establish the robustness of RAPP in addressing the needs of end users and developers, as well as its contribution in significantly increasing the quality of life of senior citizens. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",1,1,1,0
"Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis. BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",1,0,0,1
"Designing virtual avatars to empower social participation among older adults. Social participation among older adults improves quality of life, reducing negative emotions that may lead to depression or premature death. The use of virtual avatars (self representations of the user) in online environments can support social participation by providing opportunities for enjoyment. These new online self-representations can affect the behavior of users in both the digital and the physical world. However, further study is needed to identify how to promote social participation for older adults through appropriate design of avatars.

"Does social network site use buffer against well-being loss when older adults face reduced functional ability?. We examine the role of the Internet in dealing with problems in later life by analyzing whether direct and buffering models of social support can be applied to social network site (SNS) use. Whereas the direct model implies a positive effect of time spent using SNSs on subjective well-being, and a negative effect on social loneliness, the buffering model suggests that SNS use should reduce the (negative) consequences of stressors. Using a large, longitudinal survey from the Netherlands, we find evidence for the buffering model but not for the direct-effects model. Functional disability had a negative impact on (changes in) well-being and this effect was smaller when older individuals used SNSs more. Furthermore, we found a similar buffering effect of making online purchases, which we interpret as support for the idea that replacing offline with online activities may be a compensation strategy. This implies that Internet use may play a role in coping with health-related problems connected to later stages of the life course. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",0,0,0,0
"Can videoconferencing affect older people’s engagement and perception of their social support in long-term conditions management: a social network analysis from the Telehealth Literacy Project. Social support is a key component in managing long-term conditions. As people age in their homes, there is a greater risk of social isolation, which can be ameliorated by informal support networks. This study examined the relationship between changes in social support networks for older people living in a regional area following weekly videoconference groups delivered to the home. Between February and June 2014, we delivered 44 weekly group meetings via videoconference to participants in a regional town in Australia. The meetings provided participants with education and an opportunity to discuss health issues and connect with others in similar circumstances. An uncontrolled, pre-post-test methodology was employed. A social network tool was completed by 45 (87%) participants either pre- or post-intervention, of which 24 (46%) participants completed the tool pre- and post-intervention. In addition, 14 semi-structured interviews and 4 focus groups were conducted. Following the intervention, participants identified increased membership of their social networks, although they did not identify individuals from the weekly videoconference groups. The most important social support networks remained the same pre- and post-intervention namely, health professionals, close family and partners. However, post-intervention participants identified friends and wider family as more important to managing their chronic condition compared to pre-intervention. Participants derived social support, in particular, companionship, emotional and informational support as well as feeling more engaged with life, from the weekly videoconference meetings. Videoconference education groups delivered into the home can provide social support and enhance self-management for older people with chronic conditions. They provide the opportunity to develop a virtual social support network containing new and diverse social connections. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",1,1,1,0
"Antidepressant prescribing in primary care to older adults without major depression. Objective: The study compared distress levels among two groups of older adults who had been newly prescribed an antidepressant by their primary care physician, those with major depressive disorder (MDD) and those without MDD. Methods: This analysis used a convenience sample of participants (N=231) who had been newly prescribed an antidepressant in a randomized controlled trial of a program to improve antidepressant adherence and depression outcomes among older adults (≥55). After determining the proportion of participants with and without MDD (using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV), the authors compared groups on demographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics, including the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey physical and mental component summary scores (PCS and MCS). Logistic regression was used to test the association of these characteristics with antidepressant use in the absence of MDD. Results: Most (57%) participants did not have MDD. This group was older (69.4 versus 64.7, p<001), had a larger proportion of white participants (82% versus 56%, p<001), and reported better physical (PCS, 43.4 versus 39.9, p=.03) and emotional (MCS, 40.2 versus 30.5, p<001) well-being compared with the group with MDD. In the final regression model, white race (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=3.11, p=.03) and better emotional well-being (AOR=1.16, p<001) were associated with antidepressant use in the absence of MDD. Conclusions: Older adults prescribed antidepressants in the absence of MDD did not report similar distress levels compared with their counterparts with MDD. Given the continued emphasis on screening for depression in primary care, it is important to consider the potential for overtreatment.",0,1,0,1
"Evaluating human activity-based ambient lighting displays for effective peripheral communication. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) applications leverage pervasive sensing and ambient intelligence technologies to enable older people to live independently and to support their social inclusion and connectedness. Wearable sensors can be used to gather the elderly's activities of daily living (ADLs) data, thus enabling remote monitoring. Lately, ambient displays have been deployed to relay activity information in the periphery of the caregivers' attention in order to increase awareness of the activities of the elderly and to create a sense of connectedness. Moreover, there is accumulated evidence demonstrating the ability of ambient displays to influence and promote social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. In recent years, intelligent ambient lighting, a subclass of ambient displays, is emerging as an effective tool for conveying physical activity information. Existing literature suggests lighting encodings or configurations combining color, rate of change, position and brightness to communicate such information. Within AAL, there is little empirical evidence surrounding ambient lighting encodings that support this cause effectively. In this paper, we present an exploratory study investigating how potential caregivers perceive and interpret ambient lighting configurations for presenting activity information of the elderly. User preference, change noticeability and accuracy of the interpretation of three ambient lighting configurations were evaluated. © 2017 EAI.",0,0,0,0
"“The future is ours too”: A training process to enable the learning perception and increase self-efficacy in the use of tablets in the elderly. The generational digital divide can be understood as a response to the physical and psychosocial decline of older people. Recently, there has been interest in reducing the generational digital divide because of societal costs, and several studies state that tablets seem to help the elderly due to usability and functions that easily fulfill the elderly’s needs to be connected, independent, and autonomous: It could increase the elderly’s well-being. This article presents a training program that increases self-efficiency and enables the learning perception and use of tablets. A qualitative-dominant co-occurrent mixed-methods design was used to assess the perception that the participants (50 participants over 65 years of age) had of their own learning process and success in the course, as well as their digital self-efficacy. The results appear to partially reflect previous research; moreover, perceived changes in self-efficacy and learning can be tied to three core themes—empowerment, integration, and autonomy. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",1,1,1,0
"Predictors of poor cognitive status among older Malaysian adults: baseline findings from the LRGS TUA cohort study. Background: Concepts of successful aging (SA), usual aging (UA), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been developed to identify older adults at high risk of Alzheimer's diseases (AD), however, the predictors have rarely been investigated in a single study. Thus, this study aims to explore the risk factors of MCI as compared to UA and SA among older adults, in a large community based cohort study in Malaysia. Method: 1993 subjects from four states in Malaysia were recruited. A comprehensive interview-based questionnaire was administered to determine socio-demographic information, followed by assessments to evaluate cognitive function, functional status, dietary intake, lifestyle and psychosocial status. Risk factors of cognitive impairment were assessed using the ordinal logistic regression (OLR). Result: The prevalence of SA, UA and MCI in this study was 11, 73 and 16 % respectively. OLR indicated that higher fasting blood sugar, hyperlipidemia, disability, lower education level, not regularly involved in technical based activities, limited use of modern technologies, lower intake of fruits and fresh fruit juices and not practicing calorie restriction were among the risk factors of poor cognitive performance in this study. Conclusion: This study will be a stepping stone for future researchers to develop intervention strategies to prevent cognitive decline. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",1,0,0,1
"Does Online Social Connectedness Buffer Risk of Depression Following Driving Cessation? An Analysis of Older Drivers and Ex-Drivers. This study investigates the role of online social connectedness as a buffer against depression in older adults who cease driving. A survey of 108 over-65 year olds (M = 73.7, SD = 7.37) was conducted. Measures included online and offline social connectedness; depression; online activities; and general health. The online activities in which older adults most frequently engaged were communicating with family and friends, reading the news, and banking. Face-to-face social connectedness was by far the strongest predictor of depression. However, online social connectedness did significantly moderate the effects of driving cessation on depression. The results suggest that online social connectedness can help protect older people from depressive symptoms following driving cessation. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",1,0,0,0
"Acceptance of Social Robots by Elder People: Does Psychosocial Functioning Matter?. This study aims at investigating the relevance of psychosocial functioning for the acceptance of social robots by elder people in the context of everyday functioning. It was assumed that the level of psychosocial functioning either hinders or promotes robot acceptance, depending on the fit between elder people’s level of everyday functioning and the demands imposed by the robot (user–technology fit). To investigate this assumption, two social robots imposing different demands on the user, i.e., the easy-to-handle therapeutic robot Paro (low demands) and the less intuitive telepresence robot Giraff (high demands), were introduced successively to N= 29 cognitively and physically healthy elder people. To implement different levels of user–technology fit, participants rated their intention to use each robot for both a scenario of high and a scenario of low everyday functioning. Psychosocial functioning was assessed with emotional loneliness, depressive mood and life satisfaction as indicators of psychological well-being, and social support as indicator of social resources. Results show that lower social support was associated with higher acceptance of the less intuitive robot Giraff in the high everyday functioning scenario (adequate user–technology fit). In the low everyday functioning scenario (poor fit), however, lower psychological well-being was associated with lower acceptance of Giraff. For the rather intuitive robot Paro (adequate user–technology fit regardless of the level of everyday functioning), lower life satisfaction was associated with lower acceptance in both everyday functioning scenarios. The findings show the importance of psychosocial variables for the acceptance of social robots by elder people and underline the relevance of the fit between user and technology. Moreover, they suggest a more intense consideration of complex psychological mechanisms and individual user characteristics in research on robot acceptance by elder people. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",1,1,1,0
"Photo Alive! Application and method for intergenerational social communication. Rapid increase of technology and escalation of Social Network Services (SNS) are widely being used for elderly life improvement and support interaction among family members. Advancement in technological tools and rapidly changing social communication mediums bring intergenerational gap. Due to an increase of digitalization, seniors are left behind in technological skills that caused loneliness and social isolation. Elderly need to introduce with new technological means, an opportunity has revealed for better social and technological integration. We propose a system that provides Intergeneration Social Communication (ISC) among elderly people and family members using family photos. Family Photos provide interaction with the viewer being a communication medium among members of different age groups create emotional attachment. On one hand, high tech savvy younger generation prefer smartly modified technology while on the other hand, older age people are far away from new interaction techniques and prefer simple technology. In this paper, we proposed a system 'Photo Alive!' and camera based smartphone app concerning capture photos and send to TV based 'Photo Alive!' as well as on SNS, named 'Photo Alive!' This app facilitates to remove intergenerational gap among older and younger generation by providing an elderly friendly platform by using simple and smart interfaces and techniques like Remote control, touch pad and voice. Photo Alive! Service focus age group in social media through family photos with the objective of intergenerational social communication providing family photo view service, photo tagging service and photo-based interactive service to bring elderly people closer to family members, friends and loved ones for the cultivation of family togetherness of all generations. After development stage, our system will be evaluated by easily accessible techniques for elderly through the provision of uncomplicated and smart elderly friendly interfaces. © 2017 Global IT Research Institute - GiRI.",1,0,0,0
"Using narrative with avatars and robots to enhance elder care. Elderly care is of increasing global concern. The aging population is expected to increase two-fold by 2050.

"Promoting independence, health and well-being for older people: A feasibility study of computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Background: With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people. We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access. Widespread implementation of this approach would require work to address potential inequalities. © 2017 The Author(s).",1,0,0,1
"Professional and psychosocial factors affecting the intention to retire of Australian medical practitioners. Objective: To determine the professional and personal factors associated with the intention to retire (ITR) by medical practitioners. Design, participants and setting: Cross-sectional survey of currently practising Australian doctors aged 55 or older registered with a commercial database. Participants completed an online self-report questionnaire in October 2015. Main outcome measures: Associations between intention to retire and demographic and practice characteristics; health; emotional, social and financial resources; work centrality; and anxiety about ageing. Results: 62.0% of 1048 respondents (17.5% response rate) intended to retire, 11.4% had no intention of retiring and 26.6% were unsure. The odds of retiring were higher for those with adequate financial resources (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.18-1.44) and greater anxiety about ageing (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09); the odds of retiring were lower for international medical graduates (aOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44-0.85), for those with greater work centrality (aOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85e 0.92) and greater emotional resources (aOR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.98). In amodel including medical specialty as a variable, being a psychiatrist (aOR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20-0.79) or general practitioner (aOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34e0.87) were associated with reduced odds of intending to retire. Conclusion: Intention to retire was determined by a mixture of professional and psychosocial characteristics. In particular, our results support the view that delaying retirement by doctors may be related to the primacy of work compared with other life roles. Our results may be used to develop educational programs that support the transition to and improve adjustment to retirement. © 2017 AMPCo Pty Ltd. Produced with Elsevier B.V.

"Steps Toward Participatory Design of Social Robots: Mutual Learning with Older Adults with Depression. This paper presents the results of research aimed at developing a methodology for the participatory design of social robots, which are meant to be incorporated into various social contexts (e.g. home, work) and establish social relations with people. In contrast to the dominant technologically driven robot development process, we aim to develop a socially robust and responsible approach to robot design using Participatory Design (PD) methods. The PD process builds on participants' self-identified issues and concerns, and develops robot concepts according to participants' interpretations of the capabilities and potential applications of robotic technologies. We present methodological insights from an ongoing PD project aimed at designing socially assistive robots with older adults diagnosed with depression and their therapists, and identify remaining challenges in this project. We particularly focus on supporting mutual learning between researchers and participants and on promoting active participation of older adults as ""designers"" (rather than consumers) as foundational aspects of PD. We conclude with reflections regarding how this work can contribute to the further development of social robots and relevant PD methodologies. © 2017 ACM.",1,0,0,0
"Responsive social positioning behaviors for semi-autonomous telepresence robots. Social interaction with a mobile robot requires the establishment of appropriate social positioning behaviors. Previous work has focused mostly on general and static rules that can be applied to robotics, such as proxemics. How can we deal effectively and efficiently with the dynamic positioning common in social interactions, such as the leaning behaviors we observed in conversations between elderly with hearing problems? We propose to refine the existing approach by having a robot continuously adapt its positioning behavior based on the reactions people give to its earlier actions - i.e. by making the robot responsive to feedback cues. To implement such a responsive system, we will have to develop systems for the detection of these feedback cues, as well as strategies to adapt the robot's behavior based on them. © 2017 Author.",0,0,0,0
"Please call me?: Calling practices with telepresence robots for the elderly. Telepresence robots have been suggested as a solution to alleviate the loneliness of the elderly. In earlier studies, user requirements regarding data quality, connectivity, navigation, and privacy issues have been listed, but feasible calling practices have not been established. We studied the usage of a telepresence robot Double in a nursing home by an elderly resident and her daughters. To enable her to contact her daughters, she could use ""Please call me"" buttons to send text messages to the daughters' mobile phones. This paper addresses the calling practices with telepresence robots that enable fluent communication but preserves the privacy of the residents, the care staff and visitors. Examples of practical suggestions found in the study were the establishment of mutually agreed calling rules and a ""30-minute privacy"" button. © 2017 Authors.",1,1,1,0
"Not Even Past: Information Aging and Temporal Privacy in Online Social Networks. Online social networks (OSNs) make information accessible for unlimited periods and provide easy access to past information by arranging information in time lines or by providing sophisticated search mechanisms. Despite increased concerns over the privacy threat that is posed by digital memory, there is little knowledge about retrospective privacy: the extent to which the age of the exposed information affects sharing preferences. In this article, we investigate how information aging impacts users’ sharing preferences on Facebook. Our findings are based on a between-subjects experiment (n = 272), in which we measured the impact of time since first publishing an OSN post on its sharing preferences. Our results quantify how willingness to share is lower for older Facebook posts and show that older posts have lower relevancy to the user’s social network and are less representative of the user’s identity. We show that changes in the user’s social circles, the occurrence of significant life changes and a user’s young age are correlated with a further decrease in the willingness to keep sharing past information. We discuss our findings by juxtaposing digital memory theories and privacy theories and suggest a vision for mechanisms that can help users manage longitudinal privacy.

"Daily emotional stress reactivity in emerging adulthood: temporal stability and its predictors. Background & Objectives: Emotional reactivity to stress is associated with both mental and physical health and has been assumed to be a stable feature of the person. However, recent evidence suggests that the within-person association between stress and negative affect (i.e., affective stress-reactivity) may increase over time and in times of high stress, at least in older adult populations. The objective of the current study was to examine the across-time stability of stress-reactivity in a younger sample–emerging adulthood–and examine neuroticism, overall stress, social support and life events as potential moderators of stability. Design & Methods: Undergraduate students (N = 540, mean age = 18.76 years) participated in a measurement burst design, completing a 30-day daily diary annually for four years. Moderators were assessed once at every burst, while negative affect and stress were assessed daily via a secure website. Results & Conclusions: Findings suggest a relatively high degree of rank-order and mean-level stability in stress-reactivity across the four years, and within-person changes in neuroticism and overall stress predicted concurrent shifts in stress-reactivity. Unlike older samples, there was no evidence of an overall linear change in stability over time, though there was significant variability in linear change trajectories. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0,0,0,1
"Envisioning the future for older adults: Autonomy, health, well-being, and social connectedness with technology support. Envisioning the future of older adults of 2050 is a challenging task given the heterogeneity of the older adult population. We consider primarily the domains of home, health, and social participation for individuals over age 65 and the potential role of information, communication, and robotic technology for enhanced independence, maintenance of autonomy, and enriched quality of life. We develop several scenarios to illustrate the diversity of circumstances, health, and living situations for older adults in the future. We discuss possible negative outcomes resulting from the proliferation of technology, including increased social isolation and a widening digital divide. However, we focus primarily on envisioning desired situations wherein older adults have autonomy and independence; are easily able to manage their health and wellness needs; have rich and rewarding opportunities for social connectedness, personal growth, continued life purpose, and overall high quality of life. To attain this future, we must be acting now: designing the technology with involvement by today's older adults who represent the needs and capabilities of tomorrow's older adults; developing the necessary infrastructure to support widespread availability and deployment of these technologies; and supporting the integration of technology into people's lives at younger ages with adaptive functionality to support changing needs and preferences. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",0,0,0,0
"Weak Ties for a Weak Population: Expanding Personal Social Networks Among the Unemployed to Increase Job-Seeking Success. Unqualified middle-aged and older unemployed people have little chance of finding a suitable job via Internet-based systems. These individuals have a low education level, fewer technological skills, and low self-esteem as a result of long-term unemployment; therefore, their relevant job opportunities diminish. This article describes a successful pilot project among 108 chronically unemployed Jews and Arabs in 5 employment centers in Israel. By sharing each other's lists of acquaintances under the guidance of professional consultants, 41% of them found a job. The results have strengthened the authors' assumption that educating people to use expanded weak personal networks (non-Internet) to find jobs is both effective and beneficial. © 2017 by the American Counseling Association.

"Computer classes and games in virtual reality environment to reduce loneliness among students of an elderly reference center. Introduction: Physical and mental changes associated with aging commonly lead to a decrease in communication capacity, reducing social interactions and increasing loneliness. Computer classes for older adults make significant contributions to social and cognitive aspects of aging. Games in a virtual reality (VR) environment stimulate the practice of communicative and cognitive skills and might also bring benefits to older adults. Furthermore, it might help to initiate their contact to the modern technology. The purpose of this study protocol is to evaluate the effects of practicing VR games during computer classes on the level of loneliness of students of an elderly reference center. Methods and Analysis: This study will be a prospective longitudinal study with a randomised cross-over design, with subjects aged 50 years and older, of both genders, spontaneously enrolled in computer classes for beginners. Data collection will be done in 3 moments: moment 0 (T0) - at baseline; moment 1 (T1) - after 8 typical computer classes; and moment 2 (T2) - after 8 computer classes which include 15 minutes for practicing games in VR environment. A characterization questionnaire, the short version of the Short Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults (SELSA-S) and 3 games with VR (Random, MoviLetrando, and Reaction Time) will be used. For the intervention phase 4 other games will be used: Coincident Timing, Motor Skill Analyser, Labyrinth, and Fitts. The statistical analysis will compare the evolution in loneliness perception, performance, and reaction time during the practice of the games between the 3 moments of data collection.

"Maintaining cognitive functioning in healthy seniors with a technology-based foreign language program: A pilot feasibility study. Researchers have hypothesized that learning a foreign language could be beneficial for seniors, as language learning requires the use of extensive neural networks. We developed and qualitatively evaluated an English training program for older French adults; our principal objective was to determine whether a program integrating technology is feasible for this population. We conducted a 4-month pilot study (16, 2-h sessions) with 14 French participants, (nine women, five men, average age 75). Questionnaires were administered pre- and post-intervention to measure cognitive level and subjective feelings of loneliness or social isolation; however, these scores did not improve significantly. Post-intervention, semi-directive interviews were carried out with participants, and a content/theme analysis was performed. Five main themes were identified from the interviews: Associations with school, attitudes toward English, motivation for learning English, attitudes toward the program's organization, and social ties. The program was found to be feasible for this age group, yet perceived as quite difficult for participants who lacked experience with English. Nonetheless, most participants found the program to be stimulating and enjoyable. We discuss different suggestions for future programs and future directions for foreign-language learning as a therapeutic and cognitive intervention. © 2017 Ware, Damnee, Djabelkhir, Cristancho, Wu, Benovici, Pino and Rigaud.",1,1,1,0
"An Open Architecture to Support Social and Health Services in a Smart TV Environment. Objective: To design, implement, and test a solution to provide social and health services for the elderly at home based on smart TV technologies and access to all services. Methods: The architecture proposed is based on an open software platform and standard personal computing hardware. This provides great flexibility to develop new applications over the underlying infrastructure or to integrate new devices, for instance to monitor a broad range of vital signs in those cases where home monitoring is required. Results: An actual system as a proof-of-concept was designed, implemented, and deployed. Applications range from social network clients to vital signs monitoring; from interactive TV contests to conventional online care applications such as medication reminders or telemedicine. Conclusion: In both cases, the results have been very positive, confirming the initial perception of the TV as a convenient, easy-to-use technology to provide social and health care. The TV set is a much more familiar computing interface for most senior users, and as a consequence, smart TVs become a most convenient solution for the design and implementation of applications and services targeted to this user group. Significance: This proposal has been tested in real setting with 62 senior people at their homes. Users included both individuals with experience using computers and others reluctant to them. © 2017 IEEE.",1,0,0,1
"Usability perception of different video game devices in elderly users. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usability perception of seniors on video game use with different control devices. Twenty-four seniors participated in the study (12 women, 12 men, 69 years old in average) and eight children (8 years old in average). The setting included the use of two Kinect motion sensors, three computers, three projectors, three video cameras, two audio devices, the Angry Birds and Happy Sky videogames, one Xbox 360 console, a Nintendo Wii device and a Touchscreen configured so that participants could play the games in senior–child pairs. Data were collected according to user friendliness, experience and social interaction. This study suggests that video game control devices for seniors should be adapted to compensate for their function, sensor and cognitive limitations. © 2015, The Author(s).",1,0,0,0
"Exercise gaming–a motivational approach for older adults with vestibular dysfunction. Purpose The purpose of the study was to identify possible reasons for a modest level of exercise compliance during computer-assisted training for vestibular rehabilitation. Method Qualitative design and analysis of 14 semi-structured interviews with seven participants before and after a period with computer-assisted home training. The interviews evolved around themes, such as the elderly participants' self-efficacy, motivation and acceptance of the technology. Results Age was not an excuse for the modest exercise compliance. The participants were basically self-efficient and accepted the technology, but their knowledge and understanding of the training programme were insufficient. The participants asked for a greater variation in the exercises and asked for closer contact with the physiotherapist. When Mitii is used for vestibular rehabilitation, the system has some limitations. Conclusions The modest level of exercise compliance can be explained by (1) missing variety of exercise speed and duration and lack of introducing new exercises, (2) insufficient interaction with the physiotherapist regarding the participants’ performance and lack of social contact with other patients and (3) desire for a deeper understanding of the training programme with supplying information on the parts of the vestibular system addressed by the training.Implications for Rehabilitation Computer-assisted technologies should generate feedback on the quality of user performance and inform the patient of the relevance of the exercise. The technology should support social contact among patients with the same diagnosis and establish contact with the physiotherapist at the hospital advice and feedback. Varity and adjustments to exercises are necessary to maintain motivation and exercise compliance. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",0,1,0,1
"Positive technologies for improving health and well-being. In the last 20 years there have been two important developments of great importance to the field of psychological treatments. On the one hand, this meant the movement of positive psychology, and on the other, the introduction of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve the daily clinical practice. In this paper a new field of study that attempts to strengthen ties and build bridges between them is introduced: Positive Technologies. This perspective seeks to promote the use of technology to foster personal growth and the development of human virtues and strengths, thus contributing to social and cultural development. In this chapter, we present four positive technologies: (1) 'EMMA's World', a virtual reality system developed for the treatment of stress-related disorders. It can provide to the user meaningful virtual environments capable of activating and enhancing the emotional processing of the event experienced, and fostering a more positive projection toward the future. As a positive technology, it can be classified at the eudaimonic level; (2) 'EARTH of Well-Being', a virtual reality application designed to induce positive emotions in a controlled way and reinforce psychological resources, covering the hedonic and eudaimonic levels; (3) 'Smiling is Fun', a positive technology intervention designed to generate coping resources and foster psychological well-being at both at the hedonic and eudaimonic levels; and (4) 'BUTLER', which aims to contribute to improve the quality of life of the elderly. It includes the most popular Internet services integrated into a single platform, adapting its characteristics to the needs of the elderly population. It is designed to cover the three levels of positive technologies: hedonic, eudaimonic, and social interaction. All these applications are presented and the different possibilities and advantages that this perspective may involve are analysed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

"“You, me & TV” — Fighting social isolation of older adults with Facebook, TV and multimodality. Social isolation, common in old age, leads to a decrease of both physical and psychological skills and, consequently, to a decreased quality of life and even to a higher mortality risk. Social Network Services, like Facebook, have the potential to increase the amount of online and offline social interactions of older adults. However, because of the huge diversity of characteristics of this user group, the lack of inclusive design principles concerning existing Social Network Services, and the inappropriate ways of interaction available, older adults still resist adopting these services. In this paper we present the “You, me & TV”, a television-based multimodal Facebook prototype enhanced with TV shows sharing functionalities, a new feature for sharing printed photos, and multiple interaction modalities – remote control, voice and gestures–. We present three in-depth case studies of the use of this prototype by three older adults aged between 65 and 73 years with distinct levels of experience using Facebook, during a period between 3 and 6 weeks. Results indicate that participants accepted the prototype, rated it highly in terms of usability, and that it improved their interaction with relatives, increasing both online and offline interactions. This was particularly visible for participants that were not Facebook users before the study. We also provide relevant conclusions about the relevancy of photos and how they can easily trigger interactions between older adults and their family, and how using TV as platform for deploying access to Facebook proved to be a contributing factor to their adoption. Finally, we show how adaptation and personalization concepts were perceived and received distinctly among participants. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",1,1,1,0
"Health-Related Quality of Life in Older Coastal Residents after Multiple Disasters. Objective Exposure to multiple disasters, both natural and technological, is associated with extreme stress and long-term consequences for older adults that are not well understood. In this article, we address age differences in health-related quality of life in older disaster survivors exposed to the 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the role played by social engagement in influencing these differences. Methods Participants were noncoastal residents, current coastal residents, and current coastal fishers who were economically affected by the BP oil spill. Social engagement was estimated on the basis of disruptions in charitable work and social support after the 2005 hurricanes relative to a typical year before the storms. Criterion measures were participants' responses to the SF-36 Health Survey which includes composite indexes of physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) health. Results The results of logistic regressions indicated that age was inversely associated with SF-36 PCS scores. A reduction in perceived social support after Hurricane Katrina was also inversely associated with SF-36 MCS scores. Conclusions These results illuminate risk factors that impact well-being among older adults after multiple disasters. Implications of these data for psychological adjustment after multiple disasters are considered. © 2017 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.",1,0,0,1
"A methodological approach for designing and developing web-based inventories of mobile Assistive Technology applications. Mobile technologies provide radical opportunities in the domain of Assistive Technologies (AT) for persons with disabilities and the elderly by facilitating them to access multimedia content and improve their social interaction. The search for mobile AT applications that meet specific user needs is not an easy task for the disabled users, their facilitators, and rehabilitation professionals, as the mobile app stores do not include a category for AT or a classification by disability. In this work, we first provide an analysis of the disabled users’ needs along with the required mobile software adaptations in order to fulfill them. Then, we introduce a methodological approach for the design and development of web-based inventories which make the search and selection of AT apps simpler and efficient. This methodology has to main parts, first it is based on experts in an AT lab thoroughly testing each application, and second, the creation of a consistent and well-documented presentation of the information for each app. Finally, we present the mATHENA repository of free AT apps for mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), which has been created by following the suggested methodology for creating AT app inventories. Currently, mATHENA includes 420 free mobile AT applications, carefully selected from a total of 1100. The features of mATHENA are compared with the functionality and social interaction services of six other inventories for AT applications. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0,0,0,0
"Targeting functional fitness, hearing and health-related quality of life in older adults with hearing loss: Walk, Talk 'n' Listen, study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial. Background: Hearing loss (HL) is a disability associated with poorer health-related quality of life including an increased risk for loneliness, isolation, functional fitness declines, falls, hospitalization and premature mortality. The purpose of this pilot trial is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a novel intervention to reduce loneliness, improve functional fitness, social connectedness, hearing and health-related quality of life in older adults with HL. Methods: This 10-week, single-blind, pilot randomized control trial (RCT) will include a convenience sample of ambulatory adults aged 65 years or older with self-reported HL. Following baseline assessments, participants will be randomized to either intervention (exercise, health education, socialization and group auditory rehabilitation (GAR)) or control (GAR only) groups. The intervention group will attend a local YMCA twice a week and the control group once a week. Intervention sessions will include 45 min of strengthening, balance and resistance exercises, 30 min of group walking at a self-selected pace and 60 min of interactive health education or GAR. The control group will attend 60-min GAR sessions. GAR sessions will include education about hearing, hearing technologies, enhancing communication skills, and psychosocial support. Pre-post trial data collection and measures will include: functional fitness (gait speed, 30-s Sit to Stand Test), hearing and health-related quality of life, loneliness, depression, social participation and social support. At trial end, feasibility (recruitment, randomization, retention, acceptability) and GAR will be evaluated. Discussion: Despite evidence suggesting that HL is associated with declines in functional fitness, there are no studies aimed at addressing functional fitness declines associated with the disability of HL. This pilot trial will provide knowledge about the physical, mental and social impacts on health related to HL as a disability. This will inform the feasibility of a larger RCT and preliminary evidence about the initial effects of a novel, community-based, holistic intervention addressing both the negative psychosocial and functional physical effects of HL among older adults.

"Social ties and embeddedness in old age: older Turkish labour migrants in Vienna. This paper focuses on older Turkish labour migrants and their spouses, who mostly came to Vienna as young adults in the 1960s and thereafter. They are now entering retirement age and constitute a significant part of Vienna’s older population. I analyse their understandings of transnational ageing, their social ties and feelings of social embeddedness. For those still mobile, active participation in one of Vienna’s Turkish cultural/religious/political associations is identified as a particular source of social embeddedness. I argue that these voluntary associations provide an important place for older migrants to strengthen social ties and are relatively easy to access, including in old age. Nevertheless, I demonstrate that older Turkish labour migrants are exposed to several forms of discrimination, some of which are felt especially strongly in old age, including a lack of adequate institutionalised late life care. In the discussion of the paper, I critically revisit the debate on ethnicity as a resource versus ethnicity as a vulnerability factor in old age. I argue that this debate is misleading since it camouflages other central social categories and relations. I conclude by suggesting closer attention be paid to the specific but multiple generational experiences of older labour migrants and their spouses. © 2016 The Author(s).

"An internet-based self-help intervention for older adults after marital bereavement, separation or divorce: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. Background: Marital bereavement and separation or divorce are among the most stressful critical life events in later life. These events require a dissolution of social and emotional ties, adjustments in daily routine and changes in identity and perspectives for the future. After a normative grief or distress reaction, most individuals cope well with the loss. However, some develop a prolonged grief reaction. Internet-based self-help interventions have proved beneficial for a broad range of disorders, including complicated grief. Based on the task model and the dual-process model of coping with bereavement, we developed a guided internet-based self-help intervention for individuals who experienced marital bereavement, separation or divorce at least 6 months prior to enrolment. The intervention consists of 10 text-based self-help sessions and one supportive email a week. The primary purpose of this study is the evaluation of the feasibility and efficacy of the intervention compared with a waiting control group. The secondary purpose is to compare the effects in bereaved and separated participants. Furthermore, we aim to analyze other predictors, moderators and mediators of the outcome, such as age, psychological distress and intensity of use of the intervention. Methods: The design is a randomized controlled trial with a waiting control condition of 12 weeks and a 24-weeks follow-up. At least 72 widowed or separated participants will be recruited via our study website and internet forums. Primary outcomes are reductions in grief symptoms, depression and psychological distress. Secondary outcome measures are related to loneliness, satisfaction with life, embitterment and the sessions. Discussion: The trial will provide insights into the acceptance and efficacy of internet-based interventions among adults experiencing grief symptoms, psychological distress and adaptation problems in daily life after spousal bereavement, separation or divorce. Findings will add to existing knowledge by (1) evaluating an internet-based intervention specifically designed for spousal bereavement and its consequences; (2) testing whether this intervention is equally effective for individuals after separation or divorce; and (3) suggesting adaptations to improve the efficacy of the intervention, selective indication and adaptations for different needs.

"Ageing, well-being and technology: From quality of life improvement to digital rights management a French perspective. ICTs are a critical enabler for a sustainable development that helps with unlocking human capabilities. Technology related to ageing belongs to several sustainable development targets and action lines: social inclusion, access to scientific knowledge, capacity building, cyber-security and ehealth. While the objective is the improvement of quality of life for citizens, a special monitoring is needed so as to regulate ICT use in compliance with the rights and freedoms of data subjects. How can we ensure that these tools are implemented in a way that is relevant and appropriate?

"Engaging technology-resistant elderly people: Empirical evidence from an ICT-enabled social environment. This paper presents a qualitative investigation on user reactions, opinions, and sentiments about a TV-based technological solution developed within the EasyReach Project of the EU Ambient Assisted Living Joint Program to promote social interaction of less educated elderly people, that is, those individuals who, because of poor scholarization, low income, and, possibly, linguistic barriers, still find it difficult to use computers in order to improve their socialization. Experimental data were collected by extensive trials involving 40 real-end users. A methodology called “scenario engagement” was applied to get participants engaged in a live demonstration with the mediation of a facilitator who assisted elderly people to interact with the system. Results point out that the system can be effectively employed to foster social interaction, particularly when it is introduced in a collective use environment (e.g., Senior Center). Although the focus of the investigation was on information and communication technology-enabled social environments, the end users themselves strongly suggested to include in future system releases extra functions considered as essential opportunities for their potential digital lives: that is, medical or health services and bridges toward public administration. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",1,1,1,0
"Employing a user-centered design process to create a multiplayer online escape game for older adults. The purpose of this study was to explore a user-centered design (UCD) process to create a multiplayer online escape game with embedded learning content for older adults. Older adults aged 65 and over were involved in the needs assessment and prototype evaluation. The needs assessment assisted the researchers and developers in understanding older adults’ social interaction in real-life escape rooms, which resulted in a list of design recommendations for the online escape game. The findings of prototype evaluation illustrated that older users enjoyed the theme of classical literary work, crossword puzzles, and the format of dual play. It was also found that our UCD process could not effectively address all design challenges of developing a digital escape game for older adults. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",1,0,0,0
"Effects of online group exercises for older adults on physical, psychological and social wellbeing: A randomized pilot trial. Background. Intervention programs to promote physical activity in older adults, either in group or home settings, have shown equivalent health outcomes but different results when considering adherence. Group-based interventions seem to achieve higher participation in the long-term. However, there are many factors that can make of group exercises a challenging setting for older adults. A major one, due to the heterogeneity of this particular population, is the difference in the level of skills. In this paper we report on the physical, psychological and social wellbeing outcomes of a technology-based intervention that enable online group exercises in older adults with different levels of skills. Methods. A total of 37 older adults between 65 and 87 years old followed a personalized exercise program based on theOTAGOprogram for fall prevention, for a period of eight weeks. Participants could join online group exercises using a tablet-based application. Participants were assigned either to the Control group, representing the traditional individual home-based training program, or the Social group, representing the online group exercising. Pre- and post- measurements were taken to analyze the physical, psychological and social wellbeing outcomes. Results. After the eight-weeks training program there were improvements in both the Social and Control groups in terms of physical outcomes, given the high level of adherence of both groups. Considering the baseline measures, however, the results suggest that while in the Control group fitter individuals tended to adhere more to the training, this was not the case for the Social group, where the initial level had no effect on adherence. For psychological outcomes there were improvements on both groups, regardless of the application used. There was no significant difference between groups in social wellbeing outcomes, both groups seeing a decrease in loneliness despite the presence of social features in the Social group. However, online social interactions have shown to be correlated to the decrease in loneliness in the Social group. Conclusion. The results indicate that technology-supported online group-exercising which conceals individual differences in physical skills is effective in motivating and enabling individuals who are less fit to train as much as fitter individuals. This not only indicates the feasibility of training together despite differences in physical skills but also suggests that online exercise might reduce the effect of skills on adherence in a social context. However, results from this pilot are limited to a small sample size and therefore are not conclusive. Longer term interventions with more participants are instead recommended to assess impacts on wellbeing and behavior change. © 2017 Baez et al.",1,1,1,1
"Information security, privacy, and trust in social robotic assistants for older adults. People with impaired physical and mental ability often find it challenging to negotiate crowded or unfamiliar environments, leading to a vicious cycle of deteriorating mobility and sociability. To address this issue the ACANTO project is developing a robotic assistant that allows its users to engage in therapeutic group social activities, building on work done in the DALi project. Key components of the ACANTO technology are social networking and group motion planning, both of which entail the sharing and broadcasting of information. Given that the system may also make use of medical records, it is clear that the issues of security, privacy, and trust are of supreme importance to ACANTO. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",0,0,0,0
"Effects of a Whatsapp-delivered physical activity intervention to enhance health-related physical fitness components and cardiovascular disease risk factors in older adults. BACKGROUND: This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a 10-week WhatsApp-based intervention aimed at enhancing health-related physical fitness components and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors compared with a face-to-face condition. METHODS: Participants (N.=32) were assigned to one of three groups: training group (N.=16), mobile group (N.=7) and control group (N.=9). Training group and mobile group performed the same training program, based on strength training with elastics bands and aerobic exercise, during 10 weeks; only the delivery mode differed. RESULTS: The mobile group increased handgrip strength, aerobic capacity and decreased systolic blood pressure and heart rate after exercise though there were no significant differences respect to control group. The training group decreased significantly systolic blood pressure (P=0.038), diastolic blood pressure (P=0.005), mean arterial pressure (P=0.006) and heart rate after exercise (P=0.002), respect to control group. CONCLUSIONS: Comparison between training and mobile group showed that WhatsApp-based physical activity intervention was less effective than face-to-face condition. The results indicate that the use of an online social network produced slight changes in some health-related physical fitness components and CVD risk factors. © 2015 Edizioni Minerva Medica.",1,1,1,1
"Social Support and Playing Around: An Examination of How Older Adults Acquire Digital Literacy with Tablet Computers. This study examines how older adults learn to use tablet computers. Learning to use new technologies can help older adults to be included in today's digital society. However, learning to use new technologies is not always easy, especially for older adults. This study focuses on how older adults learn to use a specific technology, tablet computers, and the role that social support plays in this process. Data for this project are from 21 in-depth interviews with individuals who own tablet computers. We examine how older adults engage with tablet devices and increase their digital literacy. The findings suggest that, for older adults to start to use tablets, social support plays an important role. In addition, a key way that many participants report gaining expertise with the technology is through ""playing around"" with the tablets.

"Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults. Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

"Work of the home and social relationships as a guide to domestic care for the elderly. New technologies might only partially solve the problem of elderly loneliness and social isolation. Ongoing studies analysed by means of a shared perspective promoted by London’s Home Renaissance Foundation (HRF) and Rome’s Bio-Techno-Practice (BTP) offer a theoretical perspective on this issue that could generate effective guidelines for technology design in this area. The stated goal of the present Italian Forum for Ambient Assisted Living (ForItAAL 2016) refers to “an innovative and integrated approach to address the socio-economic challenges of an aging population, and thus ensure the best fruition of products and services”. The vision of HRF is to promote interdisciplinary studies on the home and domestic work, in an effort to create healthy and congenial home environments. Several of these studies address the problem of loneliness and social isolation among aging populations. This research offers a better understanding of the loneliness problem itself as well as more awareness of what thriving homes can offer by way of long-term technological and social solutions for a growing demographic phenomenon. Bio-Techno-Practice (BTP) is a research empowering hub, relying on a renewed philosophy of science recognizing that many constitutive dimensions of the human understanding are simultaneously involved in scientific practice and, conversely, that human practice shapes the direction of scientific investigation (www.biotechnopractice.org/wordpress). © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",0,0,0,0

"‘My children tell me it’s so simple’: A mixed-methods approach to understand older non-users’ perceptions of Social Networking Sites. While there has been a great deal of research on younger people using Social Networking Sites (SNSs), there has been less work on older people and non-users. We present a mixed-methods design with a technology-acceptance survey and focus-group interviews to study older Norwegian non-users’ perceptions of SNSs. Our study reveals that most non-users in our sample deliberately do not use SNSs. They perceive SNS communication as cold and narcissistic and view the usefulness of SNSs to be low. This finding indicates a generational culture gap in how young versus older people experience SNSs. Privacy and security concerns are also prevalent. Non-users, expressing an interest in SNSs, believe SNSs could increase contact with family and friends, but perceive lack of competence to be a barrier. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.",1,0,0,0
"Mediating intergenerational family communication with computer-supported domestic technology. The proliferation of social media tools for facilitating interpersonal communication has inadvertently modified the ways in which intergenerational exchanges are supported. However, such technology has generally not acknowledged the complexity of designing social interaction mechanisms involving older adults, where the provided technology services and the actual needs of elderly people are not necessarily aligned. As a way to bridge this gap, we developed SocialConnector, a computer-supported domestic system that facilitates and mediates social interaction among older adults and other family members using their preferred interaction paradigms and communication media. This paper reports on the results of an empirical in-the-wild study evaluating the mediation effect of the proposed system with a sample of nine families over nine weeks. The study results show that older adults using SocialConnector were more engaged in interacting within their close social networks, whereas social awareness notification messages did encourage user participation between family members and their older adults. By addressing the lessons learned in this study, social computing designers and practitioners would be in a better position to identify plausible solutions that would improve user experience and the effectiveness of computer-supported mediation strategies in intergenerational communication settings. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",1,1,1,0

The purpose of this study is to develop a conversation assistive technology as a foundation of social networks in order to prevent cognitive decline and dementia of older adults. We developed the system that supports users for switching attention by using a robot. In the group conversation, the robot takes 4 kinds of actions aiming at supporting switching attention by revoicing. In order that older adults can achieve the task, we counted number of switching attention used in natural conversation of real older adults, then set the number as a target number of switching attention system induce. By using the system we conducted experiments for younger adults and older adults. As a result, the switching attention that the system induced reached the target number of switching attention in both younger adults and older adults.

"LGBT aging in the rural context. This chapter examines the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) older adults living in rural regions of the United States. It begins by reviewing the two concepts of rural and nonmetropolitan, how they differ from one another, and the difficulty in comparing studies of rural populations because of the resulting ambiguity in defi nition between the two. Despite these challenges, there exists a broad literature on rural populations, and the chapter reviews three aspects of rural communities: the conditions and status of older rural adults; what is known about the lives of rural LGBT adults of all ages; and fi nally, the specific issues and concerns of rural LGBT older adults. In general, nonmetropolitan areas are more conservative and homophobic than metropolitan centers, causing many LGBT individuals in these regions of the country to remain closeted in some aspects of their lives. Moreover, the low population density in rural areas leads to far fewer opportunities for LGBT-specific social gatherings. These difficulties are compounded for older, rural LGBT adults who may have less access to transportation, less comfort with online social networking, and may be more fearful of disclosure due to growing up and coming out prior to gay liberation and the development of more progressive policies. The chapter concludes with best practices for practitioners working with rural, LGBT older adults and future trends for this particular population, given the recent dramatic changes in policy related to same-sex marriage and the ubiquity of high-speed Internet enhancing opportunities for connecting online. © 2017 Springer Publishing Company.",1,0,0,0
"Age Differences in Cancer Treatment Decision Making and Social Support. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the decision-making (DM) styles of younger (18-39 years), middle-aged (40-59 years), and older (≥60 years) cancer survivors, the type and role of social support, and patient satisfaction with cancer treatment DM. Method: Adult cancer survivors (N = 604) were surveyed using Qualtrics online software. Results: Older adults reported significantly lower influence of support on DM than younger adults. The most common DM style for the age groups was collaborative DM with their doctors. Younger age was a significant predictor of independent (p <.05), collaborative with family (p <.001), delegated to doctor (p <.01), delegated to family (p <.001), and demanding (p <.001) DM styles. Discussion: Despite having lower received social support in cancer treatment DM, older adults were more satisfied with their DM than younger and middle-aged adults. Health care workers should be aware of different DM styles and influence of social networks to help facilitate optimal patient DM and satisfaction. © SAGE Publications.",0,0,0,1
"Elderly and social media: Opportunity or threat? [Anziani e social media: opportunità o minaccia?]. Although several studies found that individuals' chronological age is negatively correlated with innovations' adoption, recent evidences show that older adults are the age group with the highest growth rate in the use of social networking sites. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the relationship between elderly and social networking sites - defined as online spaces in which individuals can create self-descriptive profiles and a network of personal connections - by reviewing contributions from psychological and marketing literatures. This study examines how the use of these tools can be a source of physical and psychological well-being for the elderly, helping them to cope with the social isolation and cognitive decline. At the same time, it addresses the issue of their accessibility, examining the barriers to the virtual inclusion of the elderly in the social media, and the threats related to their use.",0,0,0,0
"Understanding the motivations of online community users - A comparison between younger and older people. With the arrival of an aging society, the major users of social network services include not only young people, but also older persons. The purpose of this study is therefore to understand the motivations of online community users. Data from younger and older people were compared; both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. This study first reviewed the literature regarding the purposes of using an online community. Second, based on the literature, a survey was conducted among college students. Finally, interviews were conducted with both younger and older people. The results were summarized and compared between the different age groups. First of all, the major motivations of young people to use SNSs include maintaining interpersonal interconnectivity, entertainment value, and purposive value (especially for homework and learning). Second, the major motivations of older adults to use SNSs are to contact friends and share information and knowledge. Finally, the major difference between young people and older adults’ motivations is the use of SNSs by the young for entertainment purposes and to kill time. These findings will contribute toward understanding the motivations of online community users across different age groups. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",1,0,0,0
"Conquering frailty with a multi-perspective approach. My-AHA Project as an example for integrated platforms, symbiosis of interventions and individualization of support for patients. My-AHA proposes a holistic view of age-related frailty, comprising frailty across interrelated domains of: cognition, physical function, mood, social isolation and sleep. Age-related frailty represents a major burden to older adults and social and health care systems. Early detection and intervention are crucial in sustaining active and healthy ageing (AHA) and slowing or reversing further decline. The main aim of My-AHA is to reduce frailty risk in older adults at risk of becoming frail by improving physical activity and cognitive function, psychological state, social resources, nutrition, sleep and overall well-being. It will empower older citizens to better manage their own health, resulting in healthcare cost savings. My-AHA will use state-of-the-art analytical concepts to provide new ways of health monitoring and disease prevention through individualized profiling and personalized recommendations, feedback and support. An ICT-based platform will detect defined risks in the frailty domains early and accurately via nonstigmatising embedded sensors and data readily available in the daily living environment of older adults. When risk is detected, My-AHA will provide individually tailored ICT-based interventions with a scientific evidence base of efficacy, including vetted interventions from established providers of medical and AHA support. These interventions will be deployed in a manner designed to motivate users to participate in exercise, cognitively stimulating games and social networking to achieve long-term behavioural change, sustained by continued end user engagement with My-AHA. By this, different platforms (Smart Companion, iStoppFalls, etc.) will be connected by the My-AHA Middleware and combine information and data from different sources with a decision support system for choosing the personal interventions. The My-AHA platform will be tested in a multicentre randomized controlled trial involving centres across Europe, Japan, South Korea and Australia. The project is currently in Alpha phase testing. Following alpha wave testing, the RCT will commence including feasibility and manageability testing of the pre-post design. During the first project year, interventions were defined and analysed for their proven effectiveness and their chance for combination. Selection of the platforms has been completed with middleware development approaching completion. The prototype setup has been deployed with the first participants in the Alpha Wave. During this time, experience on the new data protection regulation for EU countries was gained as well as for business opportunities for the developed interventions and results of the trial. This paper provides a short overview of the projects approach and current status.",0,0,0,0
"How to guide the use of technology for ageing-in-place? An evidence-based educational module. Aim: Technology is suggested to support ageing-in-place. For careand technology professionals working with older persons it is important to know how to facilitate the use of technology by older persons. This paper presents the translation of the results of a field study into multilevel and multidisciplinary educational material. Method: During home visits, community-dwelling seniors were interviewed regarding reasons for their level of technology use. All types of technology that could support activities of daily living, were included. Resulting themes formed the basis of the development of personas and scripts for education. Next, lecturers from vocational and higher technical and care education developed an evidence-based educational module from the perspective of professional service provision. Results: 53 older adults were interviewed. The level of technology use is influenced by six themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioural options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organisations; and the role of the physical environment. Four personas were developed, one of which was featured into a film, with twelve separate scenes. For each scene, lessons were developed that consisted of specific questions (first level), in-depth questions (second level) and suggestions for classes (for lecturers). Three personas were translated into case histories. Conclusion: Older adults’ perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. To improve successful technology use to support ageing-in-place, professionals from the domain of care and technology can be trained to be aware of these factors. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",1,0,0,1
"Health information behavior research with marginalized populations. As part of an increasingly vibrant area of research, information behavior scholars have shown that traditionally marginalized populations (e.g., older adults, LGBTQ people, people of color, low-income people and people with chronic diseases or disabilities) may have distinct health information needs and information behaviors. These differences may arise from unique patterns in marginalized groups' life experiences, health risks and burdens, social networks and available resources, as well as dynamics of social marginalization and exclusionary service design. This subfield of information studies challenges established notions of health information-seeking behaviours to further develop theories and models, as well as propose new models for information services and technologies. The unique characteristics of marginalized populations have necessitated the development of novel research approaches and methods, as well as interdisciplinary collaborations and community-based partnerships. This panel invites audience members to think critically about what it means to engage marginalized populations in research and the methods and approaches needed to do so in a health context. It will also allow participants to broaden their understanding about the health information-seeking behaviors of marginalized populations. Panelists will introduce and contextualize marginalized populations' health information-seeking behaviours and explore potential or existing connections between themes from a variety of disciplines. Following a brief introduction and presentations from five panelists (who are themselves exploring marginalized populations' health information-seeking behaviours), there will be an open discussion session with the audience in a World Café format.

"Facilitating remote communication between senior communities with telepresence robots. Rapid aging and low birthrate of the society is a big issue especially in suburban district of Japan. Since social participation is one of the major factors of well being, online communication helps the elderly in suburban community maintain social relationships by receiving various kinds of services provided from urban area. Our research group introduced a remote IT classroom for senior citizens as an example of local senior communities support each other by connecting those communities through the Internet. This remote IT classroom is based on video conferencing system, and the IT lecturer and his assistants in urban district taught participants live in suburban district how to use tablet devices. From previous study, assistants pointed out that they had difficulties in establishing conversation with the students. Thus we propose the use of telepresence robots in order to overcome this issue. Results from the remote IT classroom indicated that the application of telepresence robots lowered the barrier for initiating conversation between remote assistants and local students. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",1,0,0,0
"Utilizing social media to share knowledge of healthcare and improve subjective wellbeing of aging people. In recent decades, many healthcare service providers embrace social media to spread knowledge to the public and communicate with them. However, elderly people are not paid much attention. As we know, more and more countries have to face the challenge of rapidly aging and it is vital to meet their demands of healthcare such as how to manage their chronic diseases by themselves. Information technology (IT) may provide solutions and studies on IT use in different contexts of aging have emerged. However, research relating IT use to healthcare knowledge sharing and wellbeing of aging people is limited. This study aims to examine relations among social media use, healthcare knowledge sharing, and seniors’ wellbeing in the context of China. For this purpose, we use a mixed method to test our conceptual model, which consists of both quasi-experiment and questionnaire survey conducted with retired elderly people. Our research can give healthcare service providers suggestions about how to use social media to increase seniors’ knowledge of self-management and to improve their wellbeing. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",1,1,1,0
"Designing a digital social innovation platform: From case studies to concepts. Governments in the western countries are faced with a number of growing social challenges, such as unemployment, migration, ageing population, explosion of chronic disease. Although they offer a wide range of public social services, we cannot assume that the economy will grow at a rate that can fund expanding needs for services risen by these challenges. We have to find new ways to adapt service provision and prevent social exclusion. Social innovations are new approaches to addressing social needs through engaging beneficiaries and supporting actors in the development of solutions. There is great potential in exploiting digital networks for social innovation. Supporting virtual communities and new forms of collaboration, digital networks make it possible to co-create knowledge and solutions at a wide scale. Various digital social innovation platforms have emerged in the recent years. However we observe that these platforms focus on specific areas, such as open democracy, collaborative consumption or environment, rather than providing support for a wide range of social challenges. We propose to develop a digital social innovation platform that facilitates citizens and organisations to collaboratively develop innovative social solutions. From the analysis of the current innovation processes and the expectations of two distinct cases, Cibervoluntarios (CIB) and Experts-In-Teamwork (EiT), we derive an initial set of concepts that serve as a basis for the development of a methodology and platform for social innovation. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",0,0,0,0

"A Telepresence Robot in Residential Care: Family Increasingly Present, Personnel Worried About Privacy. Elderly people moving into assisted living facilities often face profound changes in their daily routines and social relationships, which may lead to feelings of social isolation and even to depression. Telepresence robots can alleviate this by enabling easily accessible virtual presence of family members and other close ones at the ward. Telepresence robots have been tested in different care environments with often positive responses, but there are still challenges, both technical and non-technical, that hinder the wider adoption of the robots in residential care settings. We seek for more understanding of the non-technical challenges by studying the use of a telepresence robot Double in a residential care facility. In a 12-week field trial, we installed a telepresence robot in a room of a long-term care home resident for communicating with her family members. The qualitative interview data included the perspectives of the resident, her family members and care workers at the ward. The results confirm the potential of telepresence robots in assisted living in order to increase the presence of family members to the resident and vice versa; the study also provides insight about how the increased presence of family members may affect the care work. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",1,1,1,0
"The impact of facebook on the quality of life of senior citizens in Cape Town. Social Networking Sites (SNSs), such as Facebook, can be used to maintain social connectedness especially with friends and family, irrespective of geographical distances or physical impairments. This is particularly beneficial for older people who are more prone to social exclusion. This paper investigates the impact that the use of Facebook has on the quality of life (QOL) of senior citizens living in Cape Town. The study use a positivist approach with a conceptual model comprised of parts of Kleine’s Choice Framework and CASP-19 as the theoretical lens for evaluation of how Facebook impacts the QOL of senior citizens in Cape Town. Results of an anonymous survey confirmed that respondents were light users of Facebook, using only a limited number of features. The research also revealed that the respondents used Facebook primarily to stay socially engaged with their friends and family which adds happiness to their lives and ultimately translates to an improved QOL. The results reinforced a causal relationship between Facebook use and the QOL of senior citizens in Cape Town. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.",1,0,0,0
"Augmenting object with IoT to enhance elders’ social life. We describe an IoT system composed by a thermos flask with embedded sensors, microprocessor and network interface. The system connects to the internet after recognizing activity and sends a message over online social network-OSN (e.g. Twitter/Facebook) when hot coffee is brewed. The idea is to create a device that engage people to interact face-to-face, bringing old habits of drinking coffee as an excuse to socialize. Drinking coffee with friends is a world habit; in the south of Brazil the tradition to cultivate and drink coffee is very strong (especially in elderly people’s life). The device is set to an ideal scenario and we can collect data from user’s brewing coffee and therefore his daily consuming habits. The prototype is being improved before testing it with a large number of users and has providing new perspectives about the concept of “OSN based on IoT” and IoT to promote social interaction. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2017.",0,0,0,0
"A reconfigurable supporting connected health environment for people with chronic diseases. Digital healthcare is becoming increasingly important as the ageing population and the number of people diagnosed with chronic diseases is increasing. The face of healthcare delivery has changed radically and at its core is a digital and customer revolution. Connected health is the convergence of medical devices, security devices, and communication technologies. It enables patients to be monitored and treated remotely from their home or primary care facility rather than attend outpatient clinics or be admitted to hospital. This chapter discusses the recent advances in connected health technologies and applications. The authors investigate a reconfigurable supporting connected health solution for people with chronic diseases using reconfigurable hardware and intelligent data interpretation and analysis. In addition, a thorough review of the existing information and communications technologies and challenges in the area of connected health including embedded medical devices, sensors, social networking, knowledge management, data fusion, and cloud computing is presented in this chapter. Finally, future directions and ongoing research in the area of connected health are presented. © 2018, IGI Global.",0,0,0,0
"Active ageing agents. Supporting active and healthy ageing is important both to improve the quality of life of elderly citizens, help them contribute to society as they grow older and to reduce unsustainable pressure on health systems. From social networks to health and fitness, a lot of mobile devices applications (apps) are being developed every day. The variety and availability is such that people start to think that indeed “there’s an app for everything”. Many of these apps address either problems or characteristics that affect older people and that are related with the ageing process (e.g. memory and visual aids apps). They can effectively help people and are under constant evolution. However, the lack of knowledge about these available technological aids can undermine its dissemination and consequently the help that people really receive, especially those who need it the most: older people. In order to tackle the afore mentioned barriers, particularly those related to the profusion of aid apps and the difficulties it creates to the user to select the appropriate ones, we envisage the development of a multi-agent recommender system. The system will combine the results of different algorithms in order to propose the appropriate apps. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",0,0,0,0
"Sensor-driven detection of social isolation in community-dwelling elderly. Ageing-in-place, the ability to age holistically in the community, is increasingly gaining recognition as a solution to address resource limitations in the elderly care sector. Effective elderly care models require a personalised and all-encompassing approach to caregiving. In this regard, sensor technologies have gained attention as an effective means to monitor the wellbeing of elderly living alone. In this study, we seek to investigate the potential of non-intrusive sensor systems to detect socially isolated community dwelling elderly. Using a mixed method approach, our results showed that sensor-derived features such as going-out behavior, daytime napping and time spent in the living room are associated with different social isolation dimensions. The average time spent outside home is associated with the social loneliness level, social network score and the overall social isolation level of the elderly and the time spent in the living room is positively associated with the emotional loneliness level. Further, elderly who perceived themselves as socially lonely tend to take more naps during the day time. The findings of this study provide implications on how a non-intrusive sensor-based monitoring system comprising of motion-sensors and a door contact sensor can be utilized to detect elderly who are at risk of social isolation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",1,0,0,0

"Design of a community-supported capable microwave system for people with intellectual and physical disabilities. Product personalisation has become a central topic and expected part of every day life. Different people have different characteristics and abilities and each user has different needs which means that products have to be tailored accordingly. Microwave ovens are one of the most commonly used home appliances. People use them to quickly heat or cook certain foods. Today, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 90% of U.S. households own a microwave oven. This project seeks to enable people with intellectual disabilities and physical impairments to perform simple cooking tasks. The target group includes ageing people who experience difficulties in using microwave systems, with a particularly low grade of autonomy in preparing foods and meals. In order to address the specific needs of the defined group of users, the research follows the principles of the Quality Function Deployment analysis and takes inspiration from the DfA (Design for All) theories and the UCD (User Centred Design) method. The aim of the research is to find new solutions in order to simplify certain activities of daily living for users who would otherwise be excluded from these actions. In the second stage, the project, seeks to provide a set of tools that enable the interaction with smart appliances to grow the sense of community, by sharing information within a social network and a Cloud-based service system. The main challenge is to create a “Community Supported Appliance” that provides technology and settings for enabling users in performing one daily activity. The CSA is intended to be a simple to use, affordable learning system, continuously fed from the community of carers and service users, that has the potential to be used, in the near future, by a wider group of people. A device of this type benefits from added value given from expert users to others in the community, in the form of sequenced multimedia instructions to the person and direct operating instructions to the appliance. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",1,0,0,0
"M-health predictive data analysis of daily activities and physiological conditions. The wearable devices technology has evolved dramatically in many respects over the last decade, e.g., in the accuracy and quality of the data provided, as well as the number of parameters measured. This created new opportunities not only in the fitness domain, but also in the well-being and general health. Indeed, each day, an ever-increasing number of people are interested in monitoring their daily habits and activities, as well as their physiological and psychological condition, aiming to improve their overall quality of life. Such tasks can be realized by the use of predictive tools that can guide and support individuals during their daily living activities. In this regard, wearable devices produce large volume of data, which should be properly analyzed in a fast and personalized manner. Furthermore, in order to provide the individuals with more effective and actionable information, other individuals and health professionals should be involved in the process. Having this in mind, this paper presents a smart health collaborative approach that considers the extensive analysis of the individual's wearable data, as well as a health social network to provide an infrastructure for the individuals to manage their data and easily interact with others individuals and physicians. The experiments focused on the data analysis module and considered data from four elderly individuals, wearing a Fitbit Charge HR. A clustering analysis was performed to identify and characterize patterns in their physiological behaviors and daily activities that were used for the prediction of the individuals' daily conditions and activities.",1,0,0,0
"Protest mobilization of Kumyks in Dagestan: From the land question to the constitutional self-government. The study analyzes the mobilization tendencies amongst the Kumyk population in Dagestan during the first half of 2017 as a result of land reforms that legalize previously illegal villages formed during resettlements from the mountain highlands to the fertile lowlands, which the Kumyk population considers historically their property. The challenge in regulating the land conflicts stems from the ability of each side to mobilize their co-ethnics, resulting in escalation of the conflict. This work shows that ethnic activists increasingly appealing to the norms of sharia law as an alternative to address the land conflicts, operating under a context in which Russian laws are overwhelmingly ignored, it demonstrates that activists increasingly utilize both Russian legal processes and Islamic norms, establishing agreements that allow rely on religious authorities and community elders. The inability to regulate the land conflicts has served as a reason for the consolidation of the Kumyk activists as representatives of the Kumyk ethnicity. This issue has created socio-political risks that can exacerbate ethnic tensions, specifically between Kumyk and Avars ethnicities in Dagestan. Utilizing content analysis of popular Kumyk social networks and traditional media and internet resources, this research describes the modern protest discourse amidst Informal Kumyk leaders in Dagestan where particular attention is paid to the political status of the Kumyk population. Also highlighted in this work is the crisis of trust to government Institutions as evident in the ineffectiveness of attempts at dialogue between Informal Kumyk leaders and government officials. © 2017 Russian Academy of Sciences.

"Motivational determinants of exergame participation for older people in assisted living facilities: Mixed-methods study. Background: Exergames (exercise-based videogames) for delivering strength and balance exercise for older people are growing in popularity with the emergence of new Kinect-based technologies; however, little is known about the factors affecting their uptake and usage by older people. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the factors that may influence the motivation of older people to use exergames to improve their physical function and reduce fall risk. Methods: Mixed methods were employed in which 14 semistructured interviews were conducted with older people (n=12, aged 59-91 years) from 2 assisted living facilities in the North West of the United Kingdom. The older people participated in a 6-week trial of exergames along with one manager and one physiotherapist; 81 h of observation and Technology Acceptance Model questionnaires were conducted. Results: The findings suggest that the participants were intrinsically motivated to participate in the exergames because of the enjoyment experienced when playing the exergames and perceived improvements in their physical and mental health and social confidence. The social interaction provided in this study was an important extrinsic motivator that increased the intrinsic motivation to adhere to the exergame program. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that exergames may be a promising tool for delivering falls prevention exercises and increasing adherence to exercise in older people. Understanding the motivation of older people to use exergames may assist in the process of implementation.",0,0,0,1
"Using intelligent personal assistants to strengthen the elderlies’ social bonds: A preliminary evaluation of amazon alexa, google assistant, microsoft cortana, and apple siri. Social isolation and loneliness are among the important factors for the degradation of the life quality as the persons’ aging process advances. These factors can have a pronounced effect on the general health and are caused by the decrease in social interaction by the person with the friends, family and ex-coworkers groups. On the other hand, the software and hardware technologies has reached a maturation point were the electronic assistants can acquire information from the user through camera images, as well as to communicate with the user by means of natural voice language. In this context, a model for the adoption of electronic intelligent assistants by the elderlies has been proposed in previous work. In the current work, it is assessed the possibility of using the current consumer assistants to implement the proposed model.

"The biology of inequalities in health: The LIFEPATH project. Socioeconomic differences in health have been consistently observed worldwide. Physical health deteriorates more rapidly with age among men and women with lower socioeconomic status (SES) than among those with higher SES. The biological processes underlying these differences are best understood by adopting a life course approach. In this paper we introduce the pan- European LIFEPATH project which uses multiple cohorts - including biomarker data - to investigate ageing as a phenomenon with two broad stages across life: build-up and decline. The ‘build-up’ stage, from conception and early intra-uterine life to late adolescence or early twenties, is characterised by rapid successions of developmentally and socially sensitive periods. The second stage, starting in early adulthood, is a period of ‘decline’ from maximum attained health to loss of function, overt disease and death. LIFEPATH adopts a study design that integrates social science and public health approaches with biology (including molecular epidemiology), using well-characterised population cohorts and omics measurements (particularly epigenomics). LIFEPATH includes information and biological samples from 17 cohorts, including several with extensive phenotyping and repeat biological samples, and a very large cohort (1 million individuals) without biological samples (WHIP, from Italy). The countries that are covered by the cohorts are France, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, UK, Finland, Switzerland and Australia. These cohorts are only a small proportion of all cohorts available in Europe, but we have chosen them for the combination of good measures of socioeconomic status, risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and biomarkers already measured (or availability of blood samples for further testing). The majority of cohorts include ‘hard’ outcomes (diabetes, cancer, Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), total mortality), and the extensively phenotyped cohorts also include several measurements of the functional components of healthy ageing, including frailty, impaired vision, cognitive function, renal and brain function, osteoporosis, sleep disturbances and mental health. All age groups are represented with two birth cohorts, one cohort of adolescents and several cohorts encompassing young adults (age 18 and above). Furthermore, there is a strong representation of elderly subjects in seven cohorts. The specific objectives of the project are: (a) to show that healthy ageing is an achievable goal for society; (b) to improve the understanding of the mechanisms through which healthy ageing pathways diverge by SES, by investigating life course biological pathways using omic technologies; (c) to examine the consequences of the current economic recession on health and the biology of ageing (and the consequent increase in social inequalities); (d) to provide updated, relevant and innovative evidence for healthy ageing policies (particularly ‘health in all policies’) using both observational studies and an experimental approach based on a reanalysis of data from a ‘conditional cash transfer’ randomised experiment in New York and new data collected as part of an earned income tax credit randomised experiment in Atlanta and New York. To achieve these objectives, data are used from three categories of studies: 1. national census-based followup data to obtain mortality by socioeconomic status; 2. cohorts with intense phenotyping and repeat biological samples; 3. large cohorts with biological samples. With these objectives and methodologies, LIFEPATH seeks to provide updated, relevant and innovative evidence to underpin future policies and strategies for the promotion of healthy ageing, targeted disease prevention and clinical interventions that address the issue of social disparities in ageing and the social determinants of health. The present paper describes the design and some initial results of LIFEPATH as an example of the integration of social and biological sciences to provide evidence for public health policies. © 2017, Society for Longitudinal and Life Course Studies.

"The travel needs of older people and what happens when people give-up driving. The population of older people in the ‘western world’ is increasing both in number, as well a percentage of the overall population. Changes in lifestyle as a result of increased longevity and better health and social care mean that older people are being mobile later on in their life than ever before. This qualitative study adopts an iterative and grounded theory approach to eliciting and generating the travel needs of older drivers through in-depth qualitative research with 26 older car drivers and 31 ex-car drivers. The findings suggest three levels of travel needs, these being; practical, psychosocial and aesthetic. At a primary level, practical needs encompass day-to-day, functional and utilitarian travel needs. The secondary level, psychosocial needs, include a sense of control and independence, enhancing status and defining (personal and social) roles. The tertiary level are aesthetic needs, such as travel for pleasure and for enjoyment. Psychosocial and aesthetic needs are less obvious to the participants themselves, but arguably are of equal importance as practical needs. However, less provision is made forolder people in meeting these needs when they give-up driving. This has implications for design of travel services for older people: highlighting the importance to place emphasis not only on practical aspects of travel, but also on meeting psychosocial and aesthetic needs. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.",1,0,0,0
"Occupational therapy students’ perceptions of the role of robots in the care for older people living in the community. Background. The question arises how recent developments in robotics can contribute to the care for older people. The study is part of the EU-funded ENRICHME project. Objectives of Study. The aim of the study was to investigate opinions of occupational therapy students (OTS), as future professional caregivers, on the use of robots in care for older people. Methods. It included 26 OTS from Poznan University of Medical Sciences. To collect data, the Users’ Needs, Requirements, and Abilities Questionnaire (UNRAQ) was developed. Findings. OTS perceived the robot as “a useful device” and “an assistant” rather than “a companion” (P < 0.01). In their opinion, the most important functions of the robot were related to health aspects (emergency alarms, health parameters monitoring, physical activity and memory training, and reminders about medication, drinks, etc.), scored positively by 23-26 OTS. Functions such as mood detection, encouraging to contact with friends, and monitoring of food consumption were accepted by 16-17 OTS. Two statements concerning social functions (accompanying in everyday activities and decreasing the sense of loneliness) were rated positively by less the than half of the participants. Limitations and Recommendations for Further Research. A module concerning technology use, including robotics, should constitute an important part of the curricula of both academic and continuous education of OTS. © 2017 Sławomir Tobis et al.",0,0,0,1
"Ageing positively with digital games. Active ageing is the process of optimizing health, social participation and security in order to enhance the quality of life of older individuals. Building on the paradigm of Positive Technology, we argue that new advanced technologies may offer interesting solutions to enhance well-being in the elderly. Specifically, digital games deserve a special attention because recent studies show that the elderly are receptive towards the adoption of digital games and the number of older gamers is increasing. In the present contribution, we review the potential of digital games in enhancing positive emotions, engagement and social connectedness, and outline future challenges for research and guidelines for game designers interested in this peculiar field. ï¿½ ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2017.",0,0,0,0

"An investigation of information sought by caregivers of Alzheimer's patients on online peer-support groups. Alzheimer's caregivers seek social support through online communities to deal with their issues. The research team conducted a content analysis of ALZConnected.org to investigate the characteristics of information searched by caregivers and responses received. Two-hundred fifty posts and related responses were randomly selected and analyzed using a classification tool derived from the analysis of 500 posts and related responses spanning a yearlong period. The Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) generated an average tone rating of 25.94 for the posts and 52.69 for the responses. The findings highlighted the caregiver's need for emotional support (59.6%), and confusion about Alzheimer's symptoms (12%). Most responses suggested informational resources (40.16%) and advised to seek professional assistance (21.31%). One of the key needs identified to inform future design of an Alzheimer's Caregiver Forum was a design sensitive to the capabilities of its elder user audience.",0,0,0,0
"RegionAAL: The styrian AAL-test-region in Graz, Deutschlandsberg and Leibnitz. As a result of demographic change and increasing life expectancy, challenges in providing care for elderly people is expected. Furthermore, older people seek to remain in their own living environment as long as possible in order to retain a certain quality of life. Due to chronic conditions, multi-morbidity and social isolation our care system has to face challenges in order to accomplish the above mentioned. Active and assisted living (AAL) technologies try to meet these challenges but only a few technologies have been effective so far. This study measures the usability and acceptability of existing AAL-technologies which are bundled in a package for older people in home care or assisted living. Possible impacts of using AAL-technologies on the quality of life and the independence in older age are monitored between 07/2017 and 09/2018 in a two-armed randomized controlled trial (N=240).",1,1,1,0
"Facebook and the elderly: The benefits of social media adoption for aged care facility residents. We explore the emotional effects of implementing Facebook in an aged care facility and evaluate whether computers and Facebook are of any benefit in regard to an elderly person’s feeling of social connectedness. This preliminary qualitative study took place in a Melbourne-based elected Aged Care Facility. Facebook was accessed through desktop computers provided by the Facility. During a four month pilot project, six residents were supervised to learn how to competently Facebook. Findings indicate that older people are able to connect and learn the use of new technologies with which they may be unfamiliar. While high levels of user enjoyment were found, measures of social connectedness resulting from the use of Facebook use were inconclusive. The research con-cludes that when supported with appropriate teaching and technology, the use of computers to access Facebook is a practical approach in supporting the con-nectedness needs of the residents. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",1,1,1,0
"Benefits and pitfalls in utilization of the internet by elderly people. The role of advanced technologies is being discussed in public, academic and government environments. The paper deals with the current issue of computer literacy in the elderly people with focus not only on benefits but also on pitfalls connected with their use. The paper brings an insight into the technical literature review. It strives to summarize key beneficial outcomes and contrary unexpected obstacles which elderly people face when they use information and communication technology. A set of examples as practical demonstrations of real computer usage by elderly people illustrates the issue on the national scene. The research was run to explore the computer literacy in elderly people from three perspectives, roughly corresponding to three kinds of elderly people reflecting their physical and mental state. Findings from the surveys which were conducted with a group of elderly respondents in the senior homes and findings from the interview with a young lector teaching old generation show the issue in the local city environment. A question on benefits of organized course for the elderly from the questionnaire explores the survey from four perspectives and brings enriching findings. Findings from literature review correspond to findings gained from the research.

"Substitution of assisted living services by assistive technology-experts opinions and technical feasibility. Ambient assisted living (AAL) may support ageing in place but is primarily driven by technology. The aim of this work is, to identifying reasons to move into assisted living institutions, their range of service and possible substitutability. We did semi-structured interviews with five experts from assisted living institutions and used results to design and implement assistive technologies in an AAL environment using BASIS, a cross domain bus system for smart buildings. Reasons for moving to assisted living institutions are expected benefits for chronic health problems, safety, social isolation and carefree living. We implemented six application systems for inactivity monitoring, stove shutdown, air quality monitoring, medication and appointment reminders, detection of unwanted situations before leaving and optical ringing of the doorbell. Substitution of selected assisted living services is feasible and has potential to delay necessity to move into assisted living institution if complement social services are installed. © 2017 The authors and IOS Press.

"Technique-based game for daycare visitors with and without dementia: Effects, heuristics and correlates [Technikbasiertes Spiel von Tagespflegebesuchern mit und ohne Demenz: Effekte, Heuristiken und Korrelate]. Background: Playing of old people with or without dementia have not yet been substantially investigated. Objective: This study deals with the acceptance and impact of a tablet-based memory game, which was played on a weekly or semiweekly basis by visitors in two daycare units. Material and methods: Within the framework of focus groups the technical system was adapted for elderly users. The video-assisted data at the level of the game and the dynamics were investigated with respect to interaction and communication. Results: The analysis of psychological observation forms and game protocols, which were conducted over a period of 3 months, indicated different effects of the game on psychosocial and cognitive activation. The individual memory cards in particular served as an intensification of communication and a stimulation of episodic memory. Finally, with video analysis during the whole game setting three theoretical relationship patterns of the spheres playing and speech could be depicted. Conclusion: Coherence, separation and incoherence of playing and speech are different forms of interaction in which individual and collaborative competences of people with and without dementia can be visualized. Furthermore, the study provides evidence for the cultural theory of playing by Huizinga. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",1,1,1,1
"Internet access for disabled people: Understanding socio-relational factors in Europe. Access to the Internet has become a sine qua non-of everyday life. It also offers new routes to economic and social inclusion for disabled people. Research on the digital divide shows that social factors affect Internet access but disability status is often overlooked. This paper assesses the extent to which disability makes a difference and how it interacts with other social effects to produce distinctive forms of digital exclusion. The analysis uses survey data from 27 European countries to explore and model, statistically, the interactions between Internet access, disability status, age, gender, education, household financial situation and household composition. Multilevel analysis confirms that socio-demographic factors can explain much variance in outcomes but there is a distinctive disability effect. In particular, the adverse effects of financial constraint, aging and living alone are exacerbated among disabled people. New policies to strengthen e-accessibility, arising from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and from the European Union, are important but cannot ignore those who are still excluded from the online revolution. Disabled people are over-represented in this group. The evidence suggests that both accessible technologies and appropriate supportive relationships are needed to address this. © 2017, Masaryk University. All rights reserved.",0,0,0,0
"Transplant professionals' perceptions of long-term care residents' candidacy for kidney transplantation. Context: Given the aging end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population, kidney transplant (KTx) centers may experience an increase in referrals of patients living in long-term care (LTC) settings (eg, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, group homes, and boarding homes). Objective: To identify best practices among KTx professionals when considering individuals in LTC settings for transplantation. Design and Setting: A cross-sectional survey administered online to US transplant professionals via e-mail LISTSERVs and other professional networks. Participants: One hundred twenty-six KTx professionals working in the United States. Main Outcome Measures: The survey was composed of demographic questions and 6 hypothetical scenarios. These scenarios asked participants to assess transplant candidacy of patients with ESRD living in LTC settings based on the information provided in the scenario. Each scenario presented a different variable that necessitated LTC placement, including lack of social support, moderate intellectual disability, stable neurological condition, mild dementia, a psychiatric condition controlled on medications, and limited mobility. Results: The only scenario that elicited an overwhelmingly negative response was mild dementia with 73.9% of participants unwilling to consider such patients for KTx. By contrast, the proportion of KTx professionals reluctant to proceed with KTx in the remaining scenarios ranged between 40.0% and 50.6%. Conclusions: This survey of a large number of KTx professionals suggests that there is presently no best practice consensus regarding offering KTx to patients living in LTC settings. Further research should include a broader range of KTx professionals and should also include a study of outcomes with KTx in this particular patient population. © 2017, NATCO.",0,0,0,1
"The impact of an ostomy on older colorectal cancer patients: a cross-sectional survey. Background: Ostomies are being placed in 35 % of patients after colorectal cancer surgery. As decision-making regarding colorectal surgery is challenging in the older patients, it is important to have insight in the potential impact due to ostomies. Methods: An internet-based survey was sent to all members with registered email addresses of the Dutch Ostomy Patient Association. Results: The response rate was 49 %; 932 cases were included of whom 526 were aged <70 years old (“younger respondents”), 301 were aged between 70 and 79 years old (“the elderly”), and 105 were aged ≥80 years old (“oldest old”). Ostomy-related limitations were similar in the different age groups, just as uncertainty (8–10 %) and dependency (18–22 %) due to the ostomy. A reduced quality of life was experienced least in the oldest old group (24 % vs 37 % of the elderly and 46 % of the younger respondents, p < 0.001). Over time, a decrease of limitations and impact due to the ostomy was observed. Conclusion: Older ostomates do not experience more limitations or psychosocial impact due to the ostomy compared to their younger counterparts. Over the years, impact becomes less distinct. Treatment decision-making is challenging in the older colorectal cancer patients but ostomy placement should not be withheld based on age alone. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",1,0,0,1
"Absorbent products for incontinence. Absorbent products that collect and contain urine and fecal loss due to bladder and bowel dysfunction are commonly utilized as a first-line defense and daily management option for those experiencing incontinence. Unlike feminine hygiene products that are designed to absorb menstrual blood, these Class 1 medical devices (classified by the United States [US] Federal Drug Administration) are specifically designed to absorb and contain urine and feces. Absorbent products are also useful in mitigating the potential clinical complications from incontinence, such as skin irritation, breakdown, and the development of wounds in the perineal area. High-performing products are also vital in supporting individuals in dealing with the very stressful psycho-social implications of incontinence, such as embarrassing visible leakage, unpleasant odors, and even social isolation (Payne D. Selecting appropriate absorbent products to treat urinary incontinence. Br J Community Nurs. 2015;20(11):551-8). Individuals that benefit from other treatment options for incontinence, such as behavioral interventions, drug therapies, or surgical procedures, can utilize absorbent products as an adjunct for additional protection, personal hygiene, and confidence. These products are particularly useful in supporting persons who are unable to benefit from other treatments or interventions and therefore remain incontinent, such as disabled individuals, the elderly, or the very ill. To meet the varied needs of individuals and their lifestyles, these products include a variety of designs, absorbency levels, and options for use, and are utilized across the continuum of care, from the active and independent consumer at home, to the mostly immobile or bed-bound dependent patient in a clinical care setting. These products can be readily accessed to provide treatment in clinical settings, or purchased through retail channels in stores or via the web online. Over the past decade, as acuity rates and accompanying medical conditions have increased while the population ages, there is rising demand for more options in this product category, which has even been cited as the fastest-growing household product business (Eisen S. Betting on boomers, P and G enters the adult diaper market. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Consumer News and Business Channel; 2014). This demand has also led to increased research and continuous innovation by manufacturers to capture more market share, as they invest heavily to out-perform competitors, capture consumer confidence, and increase the conversion rate to their brands. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",0,0,0,0
"Unmet Needs for Family Caregivers of Elderly People With Dementia Living in Italy: What Do We Know So Far and What Should We Do Next?. Care of the elderly with dementia represents one of the major challenges for the modern society worldwide. The burden of dementia care often falls on the family members, entailing heavy psychosocial and economic consequences. The aim of this study was to evaluate the caregiver's perspective concerning the support for disease management on behalf of the physicians and the local Sicilian administrations (Italy), and the burden of care and effects on their lifestyle, to propose new prevention strategies and service for managing dementia and caregiver's burden. Fifty-nine caregivers of Italian elderly people with dementia (mean age, 73; age range: 63-83) were interviewed, and 55 of them completed an ad hoc self-report questionnaire composed of 54 multiple-choice questions. Our findings suggest that caregivers need more information on the disease's management, as well as on how to deal with the stress due to the disease burden. Moreover, a negative perception about the services offered from the local administration emerged. Assistive technology (AT) could be useful in promoting interaction between general practitioners and specialized centers for diagnosis, pharmacological and psychosocial treatments, and in saving costs. Moreover, case manager could follow patients and support family members within the care pathway, besides collecting and sharing information among the different health professionals involved. Further studies should be aimed at investigating whether AT and/or the use of specific educational strategies could be the right approach for meeting the needs of families living with dementia.",1,0,0,0
"Autonomously sensing loneliness and its interactions with personality traits using smartphones. One in five Americans is lonely and loneliness disproportionately affects senior citizens and international students. In this paper, we propose Socialoscope, a smartphone app that passively senses user loneliness from their communication and interaction patterns (e.g. calls, SMS, browsing patterns and social media usage), while factoring in different personality types. Data was gathered from 9 international students over 2 weeks to train machine learning classifiers for loneliness. Using smartphone-sensed data, we show that of the big 5 personality traits, extraversion and emotional stability features were strongly correlated with smartphone-sensed loneliness. We synthesized machine learning classifiers that classified user smartphone interaction and communication features into ranges of loneliness with an accuracy of 98%, while factoring in user personality types. © 2016 IEEE.",0,0,0,0
"Personalizing health-related ICT interface and application: Older adults and elderly caregivers preferences. Despite potential for preventing social isolation and loneliness, providing health care access and other benefits, older persons tend to be less receptive to digital devices. Elderly people frequently appoint complex interface and perceived usefulness as cause for not using health-related ICT. There is little information about preferences and interests of this specific population for tailored and customized technology, but according to the current literature; older users and caregivers both think that accessible and interactive design is the main aspiration. Besides that, they consider important some functionalities, especially for social interactions purposes. This study was conducted to address the interest, preferences and problems with an application for personalizing the tablet; with health older adults and social networkmg of dependent elderly individuals and to propose a new design for it.

"Algorithm for predicting death among older adults in the home care setting: Study protocol for the Risk Evaluation for Support: Predictions for Elder-life in the Community Tool (RESPECT). Introduction: Older adults living in the community often have multiple, chronic conditions and functional impairments. A challenge for healthcare providers working in the community is the lack of a predictive tool that can be applied to the broad spectrum of mortality risks observed and may be used to inform care planning. Objective: To predict survival time for older adults in the home care setting. The final mortality risk algorithm will be implemented as a web-based calculator that can be used by older adults needing care and by their caregivers. Design: Open cohort study using the Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care (RAI-HC) data in Ontario, Canada, from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. Participants: The derivation cohort will consist of ~437 000 older adults who had an RAI-HC assessment between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2012. A split sample validation cohort will include ~122 000 older adults with an RAI-HC assessment between 1 January and 31 December 2013. Main outcome measures: Predicted survival from the time of an RAI-HC assessment. All deaths (n≈245 000) will be ascertained through linkage to a population-based registry that is maintained by the Ministry of Health in Ontario. Statistical analysis: Proportional hazards regression will be estimated after assessment of assumptions. Predictors will include sociodemographic factors, social support, health conditions, functional status, cognition, symptoms of decline and prior healthcare use. Model performance will be evaluated for 6-month and 12-month predicted risks, including measures of calibration (eg, calibration plots) and discrimination (eg, c-statistics). The final algorithm will use combined development and validation data. Ethics and dissemination: Research ethics approval has been granted by the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre Review Board. Findings will be disseminated through presentations at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number: NCT02779309, Pre-results.",1,0,0,1
"A Comprehensive Evaluation of a Lifelong Learning Program: Program 60. Lifelong learning programs meet older adults' educational needs and further support their health and well-being leading to more successful aging. In particular, university-based lifelong learning programs have provided older adults with opportunities to not only develop skills and knowledge but also expand new social networks with people of different ages. This study evaluated a university-based lifelong learning program, Program 60, to identify the relationships between participants' experiences in the program and their quality of life. An online survey was employed, and 107 participants completed the self-report survey. The participants reported that classes helped increase their emotional satisfaction and that they enjoyed taking classes with younger students. Their experiences in the program reliably predicted psychological and social elements of their quality of life (p =.004 and p =.019, respectively).

"Older veteran digital disparities: Examining the potential for solutions within social networks. Background: Older adults typically have less access to the Internet than other age groups, and older Veterans may use the Internet even less due to economic and geographic reasons. Objective: To explore solutions to this problem, our study examined older Veterans' reported ability to access technology through their close social ties. Methods: Data were collected via mail survey from a sample of Veterans aged 65 years and older (N=266). Results: Nearly half (44.0%, 117/266) of the sample reported having no Internet access. Yet, among those without current access, older Veterans reported having a median of 5 (IQR 7) close social ties with home Internet access. These older Veterans also reported that they would feel comfortable asking a median of 2 (IQR 4) social ties for help to access the Internet, and that a median of 2 (IQR 4) social ties would directly access the Internet for the older Veteran to help with health management. Conclusions: Findings suggest that even older Veterans without current Internet access have at least two social ties with home Internet who could be called upon for technology support. Thus, older Veterans may be willing to call upon these ""surrogate seekers"" for technology assistance and support in health management. This has implications for the digital divide, technology design, and health care policy. © Tana M Luger, Timothy P Hogan, Lorilei M Richardson, Lisa Cioffari-Bailiff, Kimberly Harvey, Thomas K Houston.",1,0,0,1
"Implementation of an iot-assisted relay control system in social networking environments. To reduce the wastage of electric power and electrical fires that are caused by the negligence of the elderly, this paper proposes an Internet of Things (IoT)-assisted relay control system in social networking environments. The proposed system comprises a power strip; three relays for the power strip control; an open hardware platform with light, temperature, and humidity sensors; and a camera module. In particular, it can support IP-based wireless connectivity and social networking through the Telegram Bot communicate with the elderly and their authorized persons such as family, a nurse, or a social worker. The user will receive the information from the proposed system, such as on/off states of the power strip, a type of devices connected to the power strip, and current measurement values from them, through a Telegram application on a smartphone. After checking the on/off states, the type of devices, and current measurement values, the user can decide which relays need to be controlled and send text messages with the indices of the specific relays and corresponding commands to the proposed system. Furthermore, to receive any alert messages for power saving and accident prevention, we can change the reference values for the sensors. Some experimental results verify that the proposed system can control on/off operation of the three relays, provide alert message services, and check the status of the power strip. © 2016 International Information Institute.",0,0,0,0
"Internet search for counseling offers for older adults suffering from visual impairment [Internet-Recherche nach Beratungsangeboten für ältere Menschen mit Sehbehinderung]. Background: Visual impairment is a relevant problem of aging. In many cases promising therapeutic options exist but patients are often left with visual deficits, which require a high degree of individualized counseling. This article analyzed which counseling offers can be found by patients and relatives using simple and routine searching via the internet. Method: Analyses were performed using colloquial search terms in the search engine Google in order to find counseling options for elderly people with visual impairments available via the internet. Results: With this strategy 189 offers for counseling were found, which showed very heterogeneous regional differences in distribution. The counseling options found in the internet commonly address topics such as therapeutic interventions or topics on visual aids corresponding to the professions offering rehabilitation most present in the internet, such as ophthalmologists and opticians. Regarding contents addressing psychosocial and help in daily tasks, self-help and support groups offer the most differentiated and broadest spectrum. Support offers for daily living tasks and psychosocial counseling from social providers were more difficult to find with these search terms despite a high presence in the internet. Discussion: There are a large number of providers of counseling and consulting for older persons with visual impairment. In order to be found more easily by patients and to be recommended more often by ophthalmologists and general practitioners, the presence of providers in the internet must be improved, especially providers of daily living and psychosocial support offers. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0,0,0,1
"Psychological profiles of older adult Web 2.0 tool users. A study was conducted to explore the relationships between the Web 2.0 tool use and various psychosocial, emotional and active ageing factors. To this end, we designed and administered an online questionnaire to 454 Spanish people aged 55 or older. We performed descriptive and multivariate analyses using the general linear model. We obtained three types of evidence. The results show differential patterns of Web 2.0 tool use in relation to age, sex and educational level. Users reported benefits in relation to autonomy, motivation, social dimension, social participation, mood, self-esteem, and physical and mental health generally, and differences were observed according to age, educational level and type of tool. We also obtained differential psychological profiles for users of different tools that could determine usage patterns and derived benefits.

"Digital Dating: Online Profile Content of Older and Younger Adults. Objectives: Older adults are utilizing online dating websites in increasing numbers. Adults of different ages may share motivations for companionship and affection, but dating profiles may reveal differences in adults' goals. Theories addressing age-related changes in motivation suggest that younger adults are likely to emphasize themselves, achievements, attractiveness, and sexuality. Older adults are likely to present themselves positively and emphasize their existing relationships and health. Method: We collected 4,000 dating profiles from two popular websites to examine age differences in self-presentations. We used stratified sampling to obtain a sample equally divided by gender, aged 18-95 years. We identified 12 themes in the profiles using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (Pennebaker, Booth, & Francis, 2007). Results: Regression analyses revealed that older adults were more likely to use first-person plural pronouns (e.g., we, our) and words associated with health and positive emotions. Younger adults were more likely to use first-person singular pronouns (e.g., I, my) and words associated with work and achievement. Discussion: Findings suggest that younger adults enhance the ""self"" when seeking romantic partnership. In contrast, older adults are more positive in their profiles and focus more on connectedness and relationships to others. © 2015 The Author.

"Mobile Instant Messengers and Middle-Aged and Elderly Adults in Taiwan: Uses and Gratifications. For middle-aged and elderly adults with potential capabilities in finance, eagerness to keep up with the times using a mobile instant messenger (MIM) is an indispensable quality. Mobile social networking services take a wide range of forms, among which an MIM, which logs in when one opens an app (application), is a representative “core service” of the information technology (IT) system. LINE is a good example of an MIM and is particularly popular in Taiwan. This article aims to understand, through the study of other social messengers, middle-aged and elderly adults’ uses of and gratifications related to for the LINE system; this study also aims to provide opinions and suggestions related to future app design, development, and research. The results show that middle-aged and elderly adults use MIM to maintain their social activities and relationships for purposes related to affection, information, stress relief, popularity, concern, and applications. We further confirm that if middle-aged and elderly adults use a larger number of LINE features, they will use them for longer time per day and more frequently per week, and they will receive more gratification from their “behavior of use.” © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0,0,0,0
"Acceptability Conditions for Telemonitoring Gerontechnology in the Elderly: Optimising the Development and Use of This New Technology. The question of accommodation is crucial for the elderly; most of them wish to stay at home as long as possible [1]. The concept of “living at home” [2] is for them synonymous with well-being because it allows them to maintain their lifestyle and social ties with their family and friends. However, a problem arises because of the gradual deterioration of their abilities; hence the need for them to remain at home in optimal safety conditions. In order to fully protect this demographic; telemonitoring gerontechnology appears to be a future solution to this problem, while improving comfort of life, management, autonomy and eliminating the constraints of travel and distance. While the utility of this technology has been demonstrated, the focus here is on the fact that the conditions for development and use of this technology involve user acceptability and the ability to meet their expectations. © 2015",0,0,0,0
"Everybody's working for the weekend: changes in enjoyment of everyday activities across the retirement threshold. BACKGROUND: the aim of this study was to explore the associations between use of time and momentary hedonic affect ('enjoyment') in adults in the peri-retirement period.METHODS: a total of 124 adults [61 males, 63 females; age 62 (4) years] completed a computerised use-of-time recall on 4 days at each of four time points (3-6 months pre-, 3, 6 and 12 months post-retirement), as well as surveys regarding self-reported health, well-being, sleep quality and loneliness. They reported how much they enjoyed each activity on a 0-10 scale. An individual Enjoyment Index was calculated as the time-weighted average of each participant's enjoyment ratings. Time-weighted enjoyment ratings were also calculated for nine mutually exclusive and exhaustive activity domains (Sleep, Chores, Work, Social, Screen Time, Self-care, Quiet Time, Transport, Physical Activity) and sub-domains.RESULTS: the mean (±SD) Enjoyment Index was 7.43 ± 0.61, and was significantly and positively associated with well-being (P = 0.003 to P < 0.0001) and sleep quality (P = 0.03 to P < 0.0001), and negatively associated with loneliness (P = 0.003 to P < 0.0001). Mean Enjoyment Index values increased significantly (P < 0.0001) from pre-retirement (7.19 ± 0.82) to post-retirement (7.46 ± 0.89, 7.42 ± 0.91 and 7.49 ± 0.89 at 3, 6 and 12 months post-retirement). There were significant differences in enjoyment across domains, with Physical Activity (7.86 ± 1.11) and Social (7.66 ± 0.85) being the most enjoyable, and Work (7.10 ± 0.89) and Chores (7.09 ± 0.85) the least enjoyable.CONCLUSION: enjoyment of everyday activities increased after retirement and remained elevated for at least 12 months. Work appears to constitute a relative hedonic deficit. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Geriatrics Society. All rights reserved.

"The effect of dyadic interactions on learning rotate gesture for technology-naïve older adults. Older adults having limited experience with modern computing technology may find it difficult to learn touch gestures, especially the more complex rotate gesture. Social interactions, as implied by social constructivism, are assumed to be powerful in enabliog older adults to acquire the skill of touch gestures. The social effect can be reioforced with the motivational effect of digital games. To verify the assumption, we conducted empirical stodies with 59 older adults, who were divided into two groups: 17 Siogles and 21 Dyads. They were asked to play a set of digital games on a multi-touch tabletop. Results show that on average Dyads have spent sigoificantly longer time in the games and have performed a sigoificantly higher number of correct rotate gestures than Siogles. Future work focuses on anaiyziog the emotional aspect of social interactions and identifying further applications of social gamiog to other ageing issues. © 2016 ACM.",1,0,0,0
"Improving awareness and social connectedness through the social hue: Insights and perspectives. The ability to maintain a high cognitive function, autonomy and social support are key factors to promote ""successful"" ageing. The Social Hue is an envisioned peripheral awareness lighting system, which seeks to enhance social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. We adopted a participatory design approach to gain a shared understanding of the users' context, their perspectives on ambient lighting technologies and wearable sensing, privacy concerns and acceptance of a system to promote social interaction. We obtained detailed accounts of our elderly participants' social support structures and their interactions with their caregivers. Moreover, our exploratory results suggest important design requirements to realise the Social Hue system. © 2016 ACM.",1,0,0,0
"A Novel and Intelligent Home Monitoring System for Care Support of Elders with Cognitive Impairment. Background: Assistive technology, in the form of a smart home environment, is employed to support people with dementia. Objectives: To propose a system for continuous and objective remote monitoring of problematic daily living activity areas and design personalized interventions based on system feedback and clinical observations for improving cognitive function and health-related quality of life. Methods: The assistive technology of the proposed system, including wearable, sleep, object motion, presence, and utility usage sensors, was methodically deployed at four different home installations of people with cognitive impairment. Detection of sleep patterns, physical activity, and activities of daily living, based on the collected sensor data and analytics, was available at all times through comprehensive data visualization solutions. Combined with clinical observation, targeted psychosocial interventions were introduced to enhance the participants' quality of life and improve their cognitive functions and daily functionality. Meanwhile, participants and their caregivers were able to visualize a reduced set of information tailored to their needs. Results: Overall, paired-sample t-test analysis of monitored qualities revealed improvement for all participants in neuropsychological assessment. Moreover, improvement was detected from the beginning to the end of the trial, in physical condition and in the domains of sleep. Detecting abnormalities via the system, for example in sleep quality, such as REM sleep, has proved to be critical to assess current status, drive interventions, and evaluate improvements in a reliable manner. Conclusion: It has been proved that the proposed system is suitable to support clinicians to reliably drive and evaluate clinical interventions toward quality of life improvement of people with cognitive impairment. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

"Mapping the two levels of digital divide: Internet access and social network site adoption among older adults in the USA. Older adults have increasingly adopted Internet and social network sites (SNSs), but little communication scholarship has explored systematic differences in access within this population. Using a nationally representative sample of Americans over the age of 50 years from the 2012 Health and Retirement Study, we examine Internet access (N = 18,851) and SNS adoption patterns (N = 869) among this sample and explore how these patterns vary by age. Regarding Internet access, results suggest that while the gender divide has reversed in favor of women, older adults who are economically, socioculturally, or physically disadvantaged are less likely to have reliable Internet access. In addition, the view that the various divides in Internet access are less of a concern for those who are younger is only partially supported, as some access-related divides do not vary by age or even decrease with age. For SNS adoption, we found that access to technological resources (diversity of online activities) positively predicts SNS use. Moreover, SNS users are more likely to be younger, female, widowed, and homemakers, perhaps because these individuals are more motivated to use SNSs to complement or compensate for their existing social status. These findings reveal unique challenges and motivations in relation to Internet access and SNS adoption patterns across the later life span. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",0,0,0,0
"The relationships that matter: Social network site use and social wellbeing among older adults in the United States of America. An increasing number of middle-aged and older Americans are using social network sites (SNSs), but little research has addressed how SNS use is associated with social wellbeing outcomes in this population. Using a nationally representative sample of 1,620 Americans older than 50 from the 2012 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we examine the relationship between older adults' SNS use and social wellbeing associated with non-kin and kin relations and explore how these associations vary by age. Results of ordinary least-squares regression analyses suggest that SNS use is positively associated with non-kin-related social wellbeing outcomes, including perceived support from friends (β = 0.13; p < 0.001; N = 460) and feelings of connectedness (β = 0.10; p < 0.001; N = 463). Regression models employing interaction terms of age and SNS use further reveal that SNS use contributes to feelings of connectedness to a greater extent as people age (β = 0.10; p < 0.001; N = 463). Of all kin-related social wellbeing outcomes, SNS use only predicts increased perceived support from children (β = 0.08; p < 0.05; N = 410), and age negatively shapes this relationship (β = -0.14; p < 0.001; N = 410). As older people engage with an increasingly smaller and narrower network with a greater proportion of kin contacts, our results suggest that SNS use may help older adults access differential social benefits throughout later life. © Copyright 2015 Cambridge University Press.",0,0,0,0
"Exploring the impact of creative expression through interactive art making on older adults’ well-being. Research on enhancing healthy aging through art-related activities is a relatively recent phenomenon. We draw inspiration from the ability of interactive art technology to merge electronics into artifacts whose aesthetics are shaped by their craft components. We believe such artifacts hold great potential to engage older adults and significantly improve their daily lives. Therefore, we developed an interactive art-making program for seniors at local assisted-living facilities aimed to enhance cognitive engagement, social connectedness and sense of well-being in older adults. This article examines the physical and mental experience of our participants as they made electronic cards by hand and explores new approaches to electronics construction that leverages the affordances of other related handicrafts. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",1,0,0,0
"Effects of a social internet-based intervention programme for older adults: An explorative randomised crossover study. Introduction Restraints and changes in social activities might contribute to loneliness and health decline for older adults. To reduce loneliness and support activities, social internet-based interventions are indicated to be effective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a social internet-based intervention for older adults who are vulnerable to loneliness. Method An explorative, randomised, crossover study with an AB/BA sequence was completed. The intervention was conducted over a period of three months. Thirty participants were included (24 women and six men, 61-89 years old) and allocated to two groups. Data were collected at three time points. The primary outcome was the UCLA loneliness scale, and the secondary outcomes were satisfaction with social contacts and social interaction skills. Statistical analyses were conducted with the paired t-test, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test and repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results Loneliness was significantly decreased in both groups post intervention, and satisfaction with social contacts online significantly increased in one group. Significant treatment effects were detected for all outcomes. Conclusion The results of the social internet-based intervention programme are promising, but further evaluations are needed. © The College of Occupational Therapists Ltd.",1,1,1,1
"Can a short internet training program improve social isolation and self-esteem in older adults with psychiatric conditions?. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether an educational training course on using the internet and touchscreen technology (TT) would decrease social isolation and improve self-esteem in residents living in a low-level residential facility. Twelve sessions over six weeks with two facilitators were provided to five participants with a variety of psychiatric disorders. Measures were completed before and after the 12 sessions. There were no statistically significant improvements or worsening in social isolation (mean score 6.2, SD 3.35) or self-esteem (mean score 18.2, SD 3.56) post the training sessions for the residents. Qualitative feedback suggested that the residents enjoyed this experience and learnt new skills. Further study is recommended using larger samples and alternative outcomes measures. © Copyright International Psychogeriatric Association 2016.",1,1,1,0
"Loneliness and social support among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people aged 50 and over. Loneliness is a debilitating condition with particular negative health effects, including psychological distress. While the vast majority of older people do not experience significant degrees of loneliness, a minority do and there are some reports that this is even greater among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) seniors. This article examines the experience of loneliness and social support among LGBTI people aged 50 and over living in New South Wales, Australia. It also explores their interest in participating in social and health-promoting activities. Findings from an online survey delivered to 312 people are reported. Loneliness was associated with living alone, not being in a relationship, higher psychological distress and lower mental health. Nonetheless, most respondents reported that they are able to gain support from both biological family and friends if they need it in a crisis. The social and health-promoting activities that were most preferred among all respondents were fitness groups, walking groups, swimming and meditation. Those who experienced the greatest degree of loneliness were much more likely than those who were less lonely to want to participate in social and health-promoting activities with other LGBTI people. The findings indicate scope for community organisations to develop targeted interventions, such as those social and health-promoting activities most preferred by the participants of this study. © Copyright 2015 Cambridge University Press.",0,0,0,0
"Chat robot coupling machine responses and social media comments for continuous conversation. In this paper we propose a communicative robot that facilitates talk with a user who lacks a chance of verbal communication with others for any reasons (e.g. the elderly who live alone). As our first trial, this system is designed to support a user to talk while watching a TV program. It features two conversation techniques: realizing natural timing of simultaneous response and providing interesting utterances from social media networks related to the TV program the user is watching. To achieve natural response timing, the proposed system includes three response functions: backchannel, repetition and machine answering. While the system keeps talking using the three kinds of responses, it searches human text comments about the TV program from social network services (SNS). When a comment is found, the robot outputs the comment by synthetic speech. A preliminary experiment is conducted to evaluate how the proposed response technique encourages a user to speak to the chat robot. The results show that average number of user utterances with the proposed robot using social media networks and the above three functions is significantly higher than that when the chat robot only outputs social media comments. © 2016 IEEE.",0,0,0,0
"The Benefits of Social Technology Use among Older Adults Are Mediated by Reduced Loneliness. Technology has the ability to enhance and enrich the lives of older adults by facilitating better interpersonal relationships. However, few studies have directly examined associations between technology use for social reasons and physical and psychological health among older adults. The current study examines the benefits of technology use in 591 older adults from the 2012 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (Mage = 68.18, SD = 10.75; 55.5% female). Social technology use was assessed through five technology-based behaviors (i.e., using e-mail, social networking sites, online video/phone calls, online chatting/instant messaging, using a smartphone). Attitudes toward the usability and benefits of technology use were also assessed. Older adults had generally positive attitudes toward technology. Higher social technology use was associated with better self-rated health, fewer chronic illnesses, higher subjective well-being, and fewer depressive symptoms. Furthermore, each of the links between social technology use and physical and psychological health was mediated by reduced loneliness. Close relationships are a large determinant of physical health and well-being, and technology has the potential to cultivate successful relationships among older adults. © 2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",1,0,0,0
"Integrating Web-Based Applications into Aged Care: Two Case Studies and Discussion. In anticipation of the growing need for adequate mental health care for older adults in residential aged care facilities, psychologists are challenged to overcome several barriers that impede the uptake and delivery of their services in such settings. Information and communication technologies (ICT) have strong potential to overcome some of these barriers by supporting the delivery of evidence-based psychosocial treatments for common psychogeriatric issues. This paper presents two case studies that illustrate when and how psychologists can use various ICT applications (e.g., tablet devices, web-based applications) integrated with cognitive behavioural and reminiscence-based therapies. Both case studies demonstrate that ICT can effectively support the therapeutic alliance, enhance therapeutic engagement, and individualize treatment delivery to accommodate the needs of elderly patients. It is hoped that these case studies will encourage clinicians to consider using ICT to augment therapy with their elderly patients. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",1,1,1,0
"Psychosocial mediators of a theory-based resistance training maintenance intervention for prediabetic adults. Objective: Examine psychosocial mediators of the effects of high vs. low-dose resistance training (RT) maintenance interventions among older (ages 50–69), overweight and pre-diabetic adults. Design: Participants (N = 123) completed a three-month supervised RT initiation phase and were subsequently randomised (time 1) to high or low-dose six-month unsupervised RT maintenance interventions (time 2), followed by a six-month no-contact phase (time 3). Main Outcome Measures: Online measures of putative mediators and RT behaviour. Results: RT intervention condition (high vs. low dose) had significant effects on change from time 1 to time 2 in behavioural expectation, self-regulation and perceived satisfaction (f2 = .04–.08), but not outcome expectancies, RT strategies or behavioural intentions (f2 ≤ .02). Change in each of the putative mediators, except for outcome expectancies (f2 ≤ .02), had significant effects on RT behaviour at times 2 (f2 = .12–.27) and 3 (f2 = .23–.40). In a multiple mediation model, behavioural expectation (f2 = .11) and self-regulation (f2 = .06) mediated the effects of RT intervention condition on time 2 RT behaviour, whereas perceived satisfaction did not (f2 = .01). Self-regulation was a significant mediator of intervention effects on time 3 RT behaviour (f2 = .11), but behavioural expectation and perceived satisfaction were not (f2 = .04). Conclusions: Findings suggest that behavioural expectation and self-regulation are appropriate targets for RT maintenance interventions among at-risk older adults. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",0,1,0,1
"Co-creating value through demand and supply integration in senior industry-observations on 33 senior enterprises in Taiwan. Objective: With global population aging, great business opportunities are driven by the various needs that the elderly face in everyday living. Internet development makes information spread faster, also allows elderly and their caregivers to more easily access information and actively participate in value co-creation in the services. This study aims to investigate the designs of value co-creation by the supply and demand sides of the senior industry.Design: This study investigated senior industry in Taiwan and analyzed bussiness models of 33 selected successful senior enterprises in 2013. We adopted series field observation, reviews of documentations, analysis of meeting records and in-depth interviews with 65 CEOs and managers.Setting: Thirty-three quality enterprises in senior industry.Participants: Sixty-five CEOs and managers in 33 senior enterprises.Intervention(s): None.Main Outcome Measure(s): Value co-creation design, value co-creating process.Results: We constructed a conceptual model that comprehensively describes essential aspects of value co-creation and categorized the value co-creation designs into four types applying for different business models: (i) interaction in experience spaces co-creation design, (ii) on-site interacting co-creation design, (iii) social networking platform co-creation design and (iv) empowering customers co-creation design. Through value co-creation platform design, the senior enterprises have converted the originally passive roles of the elderly and caregivers into active participants in the value co-creation process.Conclusions: The new paradigm of value co-creation designs not only promote innovative development during the interactive process, lead enterprises reveal and meet customers' needs but also increase markets and profits. © The Author 2016.

"HiGame: Improving elderly well-being through horticultural interaction. Family support is the key to the well-being problems of elderly. Unlike health problem, mental problem often depends on the social network of elderly. How to enhance elderly well-being problems will become how to increase the interaction between elderly and their family. Horticultural interaction proves to be an effective but smooth impact on improving well-being problems of elderly. By designing a horticultural interaction game for motivating or invoking the communication between elderly and their family members, the prototype is developed based on the framework of behavior setting and semi-fixed features. Three groups of games, physical games, virtual games, and spatial interaction games, are analyzed and 14 cases are studied and evaluated for the features required. Particularly, spatial interaction games with both physical and virtual games are brought into scope, and HiGame (Horticultural Interaction Game, hi game) is developed. Five scenarios using sensor network and mobile interface are unleashed and tested in an experiment with two sets of elderly family participants. HiGame has connection to both physical and virtual spaces for elderly and their family. Elderly interact with distant family through physical watering, weeding, and fertilizing. And distant family use virtual game to support elderly. The interaction process can be further enhanced with the following: (1) separating the tasks for elderly and family ends individually and then cooperating together might enforce the intergenerational interaction and reflection on cooperation in the gaming process; (2) the connection among each scenario can be further developed into a different process, such as competition of different members for helping the elderly to complete certain task might motivate the game experience further. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",1,0,0,0
"Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults. Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",1,0,0,1
"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study. Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

"Older Australians: Structural barriers to learning in later life. Background: Learning in older age is associated with benefits including increases in skills, social interactions, self-satisfaction, coping ability, enjoyment, and resilience to age-related changes in the brain. It is also a fundamental component of active ageing and if active ageing objectives are to be met for the growing ageing population, barriers to learning need to be understood and addressed. This study aimed at determining the degree that structural factors deter people aged 55 years and older from engaging in learning activities. Method: The data were obtained from survey (n=421) with a purposive sample of Australian Seniors aged 55 to 75+, and open ended follow up interviews (n=40). The survey responses to the 22 barriers to learning questions were ranked and quantified. The issues identified in the interviews shed further light on the survey data. Results: The analyses revealed that factors related to educational institutions as well as infrastructure were commonly cited as barriers to participation in learning. In particular expense of educational programmes (55.1%), long travelling time (45.6%) other transportation difficulties (38.9%), lack of interest in offered programmes ((36.4) and lack of information about courses (31.1%) were seen as barriers. The interviews revealed and confirmed five main barriers; money, offerings of interest/availability, travel/transport, information, computer skills and being employed. Conclusion: The findings should provide policy makers, institutions, organizations and government with a list of areas where changes might be made so as to improve older people’s opportunities for learning as they proceed through older age. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.",0,0,0,1

"SSN: Senior social network for improving quality of life. The world population is aging and loneliness has become one of the major issues affecting the quality of life of our senior citizens. Additionally, we have observed that social computing increases social contexts through the use of Information Communication Technology (ICT). Smartphone and tablet proliferation also empower people to interact and create and share contents, strengthening newforms of communication independent of time and space.Therefore, the senior populationwould have a lot to gain by using social networks to overcome their solitude.Nevertheless, the elderly are still digitally excluded due to their lack of technological skills, as well as age-related impairments.This work presents a social network tailored for the senior population where the feelings of belonging, companionship and connectivity, well-being and interaction, meaningfulness, and emotional comfort are empowered. Our contribution aims to digitally include all seniors - independent of their educational level, literacy, or technological skills - by promoting a social network that allows them to share their life experiences, strengthen communication, improve their awareness of still playing an active and useful role in society, encourage emotional comfort, improve their health condition, and provide new forms of joyful entertainment in their lives. The final evaluation indicates that all seniors were very enthusiastic about the experience. Copyright © 2016 Isabel Marcelino et al.",1,0,0,0
"Psychometric properties of the Dutch WHOQOL-OLD. Background: To assess the internal consistency reliability and construct validity of the Dutch version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Older Adults Module (WHOQOL-OLD). Methods: The psychometric properties of the Dutch WHOQOL-OLD were examined in a cross-sectional study using a sample of 1,340 people aged 60years or older. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire, the 'Senioren Barometer'. Reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha and corrected item-total correlations. Construct validity of the Dutch WHOQOL-OLD was evaluated with confirmatory factor analyses, and correlations within and between scales, using scales WHOQOL-BREF, Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI), and the Emotional and Social Loneliness Scale (ESLS). Results: The reliabilities of the six WHOQOL-OLD facets or subscales were sufficient to good (.66-.91). The convergent validity of the WHOQOL-OLD was good, whereas our findings on the divergent validity of the WHOQOL-OLD were somewhat mixed. Findings corroborating the divergent validity were that the 6-factor model fitted better than the second-order factor model, and WHOQOL-OLD facets sensory abilities, past, present and future activities, death and dying, intimacy correlated more strongly with similar than dissimilar scales. Not fully supporting divergent validity were the extremely high correlations between the factors corresponding to autonomy, past, present and future activities, and social participation. Conclusion: We offer Dutch healthcare and social workers an instrument with good psychometric properties for measuring quality of life in older people. Further research on interrelations between WHOQOL-OLD facets is recommended. ï¿½ 2016 The Author(s).",1,0,0,1
"Media and technology use among hispanics/latinos in New York: Implications for health communication programs. Objectives There is limited information about media and technology use, as well as health information-seeking patterns, specifically for Hispanics/Latinos at the state level. An understanding of access, usage patterns, and preferences for receiving health information is critical for state-level organizations to effectively reach and serve this growing population. Design A telephone survey was developed to assess media and technology access, use patterns, health-seeking information patterns, and preferences for receiving health information. The survey was conducted in New York state from August 8 to November 4, 2013, using random digit dialing. The overall sample of 1350 included 412 Hispanic/Latino adults who are the focus of this study. Results Most Hispanic/Latino respondents reported having at least one working computer at home (78%) and using the Internet (84%); almost all who had a computer reported having high-speed Internet service (90%). Cell phone ownership was common (88%), and many had a smartphone (71%). Activities most likely to occur several times per day were sending text messages (61%), using phone apps (49%), using a search engine (40%), using email (34%), and using social networking sites (32%). The most preferred channels of receiving health information were websites, mail, and television. Older respondents were significantly less likely to have the technologies, engage in technology activities, and prefer newer forms of information dissemination (i.e., text messages). Education and income were important predictors in some cases. Conclusions While most Hispanics/Latinos have access to various technologies, the reason for using those technologies and preferences for receiving health information most often varies by age and, sometimes, by education and income. Older adults tend to seek health information from traditional sources such as television and brochures, while younger adults favored newer technologies. Knowing preferences of the population can help ensure proper media channels are selected for dissemination of health information to Hispanic/Latino communities. © W.

"Training older adults to use tablet computers: Does it enhance cognitive function?. Purpose of the Study: Recent evidence shows that engaging in learning new skills improves episodic memory in older adults. In this study, older adults who were computer novices were trained to use a tablet computer and associated software applications. We hypothesize that sustained engagement in this mentally challenging training would yield a dual benefit of improved cognition and enhancement of everyday function by introducing useful skills. Design and Methods: A total of 54 older adults (age 60-90) committed 15 hr/week for 3 months. Eighteen participants received extensive iPad training, learning a broad range of practical applications. The iPad group was compared with 2 separate controls: a Placebo group that engaged in passive tasks requiring little new learning; and a Social group that had regular social interaction, but no active skill acquisition. All participants completed the same cognitive battery pre- and post-engagement. Results: Compared with both controls, the iPad group showed greater improvements in episodic memory and processing speed but did not differ in mental control or visuospatial processing. Implications: iPad training improved cognition relative to engaging in social or nonchallenging activities. Mastering relevant technological devices have the added advantage of providing older adults with technological skills useful in facilitating everyday activities (e.g., banking). This work informs the selection of targeted activities for future interventions and community programs. © The Author 2014.

"Technology use, adoption and behavior in older adults: Results from the iStoppFalls project. ABSTRACT: Technology use is a common constituent of modern life. However, little is known about older adults’ use of technology. This article presents a subset of data collected via the technology deployed in the iStoppFalls randomized control trial. The primary focus lies on questions about digital device/Internet use, ownership, length, and frequency as well as social networking. Data was collected from participants aged 65 years or older. Seventy-eight participants completed a specifically developed technology survey as part of the baseline assessment. Results showed that the majority of subjects owned a computer with men being its main user. Participants used technological devices on a daily basis for more than 1 year. The main reason for using technology was e-mail communication, search engines, text processing, and online shopping. Only a few participants used social network applications, with Google+ and Facebook being the most popular ones. Future work should consider an in-depth qualitative approach to further increase understanding of technology use in older adults. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",1,1,1,0
"Enhancing Connectedness Through Peer Training for Community-Dwelling Older People: A Person Centred Approach. Social interaction and connectedness is important to the mental health and wellbeing of older people. The aim of this research study was to facilitate and increase opportunities for social connectedness for older people living in regional areas through the use of technology training. Weekly technology training sessions were conducted at a Seniors Citizen's Club with a peer trainer (an experienced, retired computer teacher) and sessions were attended not only by the six study participants, but also by other club members, with up to 15 club members participating in sessions. Data analysis involved all documents generated by the project, including the individual interviews, researcher observations of training sessions, reports from the peer trainer and weekly diaries maintained by participants. Findings demonstrated that computer training at the Senior Citizens Club helped participants build group cohesion and to form tiered connections with partners, family, and friends with whom they no longer live. When the trainer is seen as a peer, and training is person-centred, older people are more receptive to learning, exploring, and experimenting with technology. Although only six people were involved in the in-depth evaluation part of the study, voluntary training with the trainer in the absence of any funding continues even to this present time. The outcome of this research reinforces the potential for technology facilitated tiered connectivity to enhance the quality of life for older people living in regional and rural Australia. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1,1,1,0
"Perceptions of a specific family communication application among grandparents and grandchildren: An extension of the technology acceptance model. Many studies have noted that the use of social networks sites (SNSs) can enhance social interaction among the elderly and that the motivation for the elderly to use SNSs is to keep in contact with remote friends and family or the younger generation. Memotree is designed to promote intergenerational family communication. The system incorporates the Family Tree design concept and provides family communication mechanisms based on the Family Communication Scale. In addition, the system optimizes hardware and interface use to conform to the specific needs of older and substantially younger individuals. Regarding the impact of variables on SNS with respect to the interaction of usability variables in the construction of a cross-generational communication platform, we adopted the TAM model and Chung et al.'s suggestions to promote user acceptance of the proposed Memotree system. A total of 39 grandchildren and 39 grandparents met the criteria and were included in the study. The elderly and young respondents revealed substantial willingness to use and/or satisfaction with using the Memotree system. Empirical results indicate that technology affordances and perceived ease of use have a positive impact on perceived usefulness, while perceived ease of use is affected by technology affordances. Internet self-efficacy and perceived usefulness have a positive impact on the user's behavioral intention toward the system. In addition, this study investigated age as a moderating variable in the model. The results indicate that grandchildren have a larger significant effect on the path between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention than grandparents. This study proposes a more complete framework for investigating the user's behavioral intention and provides a more appropriate explanation of related services for cross-generational interaction with SNS services. © 2016 Tsai et al.

"Investigating gameplay intention of the elderly using an Extended Technology Acceptance Model (ETAM). With the increase in an aging population, there is an urgent need for innovative solutions to help the elderly to improve their lives. Digital games have already been suggested as valuable tools for enriching the lives of old people, however, older users are less familiar with technology and are not likely to be early adopters of digital games. This paper investigates the gameplay intentions of older people based on data collected from 534 elderly respondents. An Extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was constructed to tailor to the characteristics of elderly users to explore and examine the impact of potential factors on the gameplay intentions of the elderly. The results revealed the predicting power of game narrative, the social interaction and physical condition of the elderly, and the moderating effects of age, gender and previous experience on older people's gameplay intention. Implications were derived for the design of novel digital games that could foster physical activity, social interaction and entertainment for older people, especially for those who live alone. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",1,0,0,0
"Vulnerable users’ perceptions of transport technologies. As the global population continues to grow, age and urbanise, it is vital to provide accessible transport so that neither ageing nor disability constitutes barriers to social inclusion. While technology can enhance urban access, there is a need to study the ways by which transport technologies – real-time information, pedestrian navigation, surveillance and road pricing – could be more effectively adopted by users. The reason for this is that some people, and particularly vulnerable populations, are still likely to be reluctant to use (or even avoid using) technologies perceived as ‘unknown’ and ‘complicated’. On the basis of evidence from British and Swedish case studies on older people’s perceptions of the aforementioned transport technologies, as well as of a Swedish case study of visually impaired people’s perceptions, this paper makes the case that technology is only one tool in a complex sociotechnical system, and one that brings challenges. The authors also suggest that although vulnerable populations are not homogeneous when expressing their attitudes towards transport technologies, their assessment criteria tend to be ‘prosocial’ as they usually consider that the societal benefits of the assessed technologies outweigh the personal benefits. Emphasising aspects linked to the technologies’ prosocial potential or relevance to the individual user could therefore increase acceptance. © 2016, Thomas Telford Services Ltd.

"Intuitive IoT-based H2U healthcare system for elderly people. The development on newer healthcare services for the elderly citizens has become an immediate necessity today. There have been distinctive health challenges focused in the society through technical innovations. Most of the elderly people today experiences loneliness and psychological depressions, either as a result of living alone/abandonment or due to reduced connection with their children and relatives. To enhance the quality of services in the elderly healthcare system we have developed a ubiquitous intuitive IoT-based (Internet of Things) Help to You (H2U) healthcare system to integrate various technologies of wearable devices, biosensors and wireless sensor networks in order to provide an intensive service management platform. This method would support the real time activity and monitor the healthcare system for the elderly citizens. In this method the information collected by various wearable devices in real time are stored in the central database which thereby connects people, doctors, and practitioner at the time of an emergency for the right information. This way the system could increase accessibility, efficiency, and also lower the health expenses to improve the comfort and safety as well as management of daily routines of an elderly life. © 2016 IEEE.",0,0,0,0
"A home-based individualized information communication technology training program for older adults: A demonstration of effectiveness and value. Purpose: To demonstrate the effectiveness and value of a home-based information communication technology (ICT) training program for older adults. Methods: Thirteen older adults were provided in-home ICT training by graduate occupational therapy students using an iPad. The breadth and frequency of ICT use, perspectives on technology, and perceived independence were recorded at baseline, during the 3-month training and at follow-up, along with an end-of-study questionnaire. Non-parametric Friedman analysis was conducted to verify trends in the outcome measures. The qualitative data were examined by content analysis. Results: Participants breadth of ICT activities showed a significant trend across 6 months. Leisure accounted for the significant increase, while health management and social connections activities increased modestly. A positive trend in participants perspectives on technology was evident along with a marginal increase in perceived independence. Participants perspectives were thematically categorized as technology experiences, interactions with coach, training approach, and specific activities. As reflection of the training programs value, 12 of the 13 participants took ownership of the iPad at the end of the study. Conclusion: Building capacity of older adults to utilize the multifaceted potential of ICT is critical in addressing declines in health, impending disabilities, and social isolation. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.",1,1,1,1
"Not for me: Older adults choosing not to participate in a social isolation intervention. This paper considers what we can learn from the experiences of people who choose not to participate in technology-based social interventions. We conducted ethnographically-informed field studies with socially isolated older adults, who used and evaluated a new iPad application designed to help build new social connections. In this paper we reflect on how the values and assumptions guiding the technological intervention were not always shared by those participating in the evaluation. Drawing on our field notes and interviews with the older adults who chose to discontinue participation, we use personas to illustrate the complexities and tensions involved in individual decisions to not participate. This analysis contributes to HCI research calling for a more critical perspective on technological interventions. We provide detailed examples highlighting the complex circumstances of our non-participants' lives, present a framework that outlines the socio-technical context of non-participation, and use our findings to promote reflective practice in HCI research that aims to address complex social issues.",1,0,0,0
"""Tell it like it really is"": A case of online content creation and sharing among older adult bloggers. While the majority of older adults are now active online, they are often perceived as passive consumers of online information rather than active creators of content. As a counter to this view, we examine the practices of older adult bloggers (N=20) through in-depth interviews. We study this group of older adults as a unique case of content creation and sharing. We find that the practice of creating and sharing through blogging meets several important psychological and social needs for older adults. Specifically, blogging supports the development of identity in older adulthood; fosters selfexpression that supports older adults' values; provides meaningful engagement during retirement; and enables a sense of community and social interaction that is important for wellbeing in late-life. We argue for a focus on designing for late-life development and detail opportunities for online systems to better support the dynamic experience of growing older through online content creation and sharing.",1,0,0,0
"Care partner dyad strategies to support participation in community mobility. Background Factors supporting continued community mobility for older adults warrant attention due to the relationship between mobility, health, and social participation. Although community mobility is typically considered from the perspective of individual functional abilities, care partnerships represent a situation in which maintaining community mobility has implications for the well-being of all members. Aim The aim of this research was to explore and describe strategies used by older adult care partner dyads to support and maintain participation in community mobility. Methods Ethnographic case studies of three care partner dyads were conducted using in-depth interviews, participant observation, photographs, and reciprocal data analysis. An inductive, constant comparative data analysis resulted in thematic descriptions of strategies employed by the care partner dyads. Results Three strategies were identified in collaboration with care partners: (i) Acting in accordance with the values of the relationship, (ii) Finding and using available assistive technology and (iii) Relying on social networks. Conclusion and significance Strategies identified by participants were more relational than procedural in nature, indicating the need for occupational therapists working with care partner dyads to consider historical routines, social connectedness, and needs of the care partnership in addition to functional abilities of the care recipient when addressing community mobility. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",1,0,0,1
"Landline and mobile phone communication in social companionship networks of older adults: An empirical investigation in Slovenia. Although the number of older adults with access to landline and mobile phones has grown in recent years, little research exists that investigates how older adults use and potentially combine the two technologies for communication with the members of their social support networks. Therefore, this study explored how the composition of older adults' social companionship networks is related to the frequency of landline and mobile phone communication with their network members. In addition, the study examined the association between landline and mobile phone communication as well as their relationship with in-person communication in such networks. The survey data were gathered using an ego-centered social support approach in a nationwide representative sample of retired older adults in Slovenia. The results of multiple regression analyses revealed that the composition of a social companionship network better predicts the frequency of landline rather than mobile phone communication of older adults with their network members. The non-significant relationship between the frequency of landline and mobile phone communication suggested that the two technologies very likely have a different role in the maintenance of social companionship networks. The study also found a difference between the importance of control variables related to the socio-demographic characteristics of older adults for the frequency of landline and mobile phone communication. While age, education, and living alone significantly predicted the frequency of mobile communication with older adults' network members, significant predictors of their landline communication included gender and health impairments. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",1,0,0,0
"Why concern regarding privacy differs: The influence of age and(non-)participation on Facebook. Young people have obtained a reputation for caring less about their privacy due to their self-revealing presence on social media. Although one might easily be inclined to think that young people do not care about their privacy, an explanation for this could be that young people simply have a different idea of what privacy entails. This study aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms that may explain differences in privacy concerns between younger and older people and between users and non-users of social network sites (SNSs). 1.008 users of SNS and 712 non-users participated in the study with a stratified distribution over adolescents, young adults, and adults. The results show that the difference in perceived risk-benefit balance partly mediates the relationship between use or non-use of SNSs and concern. SNS users are less concerned because they perceive more benefits relative to risks. Concern regarding privacy between young and old was mediated by their differences in privacy conceptions. Older individuals were more likely to associate situations related to personal information with privacy. In turn, these individuals reported more concern regarding their privacy. © 2016, Masaryk University. All rights reserved.",0,0,0,0
"The Dress: Transforming a web viral event into a scientific survey. Background The Dress picture recently has become a hot topic on the Internet, prompting a debate whether it was black and blue, or white and gold. Objective To investigate The Dress color perception in both multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, characterized by frequent visual system impairment with ensuing color vision effects, and general population. Methods We developed a questionnaire to record demographics, clinical features, and The Dress color perception, posted on general and MS-specific social networks. Results No statistically significant differences were observed in The Dress color perception between MS patients (n=103) and general population (n=441). Furthermore, white and gold color perception was positively associated with aging in the general population (p=0.04), whereas negatively associated with progressive course (p=0.03) and longer disease duration (p<0.001) in MS patients, independently from patients' age. Conclusion The Dress black and blue or white and gold perception might be due to aging in the general population, whereas black and blue perception, despite of aging, might suggest a specific effect of the MS burden (i.e. disease duration and progression) on the visual structures specifically involved in the white and gold perception. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.",0,0,0,1
"Implementing digital skills training in care homes: A literature review: In the first of two articles, deidre wild and colleagues look at the use of technology to increase learning, and possible barriers to its uptake by residents and staff. This article is the first of a two-part series that informs and describes digital skills training using a dedicated console computer provided for staff and residents in a care home setting. This was part of a programme of culture change in a large care home with nursing in Glasgow, Scotland. The literature review shows that over the past decade there has been a gradual increase in the use of digital technology by staff and older people in community settings including care homes. Policy from the European Commission presents a persuasive argument for the advancement of technology-enabled care to counter the future impact of an increased number of people of advanced age on finite health and social care resources. The psychosocial and environmental issues that inhibit or enhance the acquisition of digital skills in care homes are considered and include the identification of exemplar schemes and the support involved. © 2016 RCNi Ltd.",0,0,0,0
"What about us, seniors? What difficulties do we face using Information and Communication Technology?. In a society marked by rapid demographic ageing and constant technological advances, investing in studies that promote communication and lessen social isolation is justified. This study aims to present the main difficulties seniors face using Information and Communications Technology (ICT), particularly computers; writing and formatting text, accessing the Internet to browse and do research; and using asynchronous and synchronous communication services like email and instant messaging. For conducting this study, partnerships were established with four Private Institutions for Social Solidarity in the municipality of Aveiro, within the scope of the SEDUCE project. The tools used for data collection were two questionnaire surveys and a field journal. The study included the participation of 22 seniors who used ICTs twice a week, in a total of 80 sessions of 90 minutes each. The results suggest that, although seniors experience countless and various difficulties, they are motivated, interested and determined to make the effort of integrating this activity into their daily life. © 2015 IEEE.",1,0,0,0
"A protocol for a pragmatic randomized controlled trial using the Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality (Health TAPESTRY) platform approach to promote person-focused primary healthcare for older adults. Background: Healthcare systems are not well designed to help people maintain or improve their health. They are generally not person-focused or well-coordinated. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality (Health TAPESTRY) approach in older adults. The overarching hypothesis is that using the Health TAPESTRY approach to achieve better integration of the health and social care systems into a person's life that centers on meeting a person's health goals and needs will result in optimal aging. Methods/design: This is a 12-month delayed intervention pragmatic randomized controlled trial. The study will be performed in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in the two-site McMaster Family Health Team. Participants will include 316 patients who are 70years of age or older. Participants will be randomized to the Health TAPESTRY approach or control group. The Health TAPESTRY approach includes intentional, proactive conversations about a person's life and health goals and health risks and then initiation of congruent tailored interventions that support achievement of those goals and addressing of risks through (1) trained volunteers visiting clients in their homes to serve as a link between the primary care team and the client; (2) the use of novel technology including a personal health record from the home to link directly with the primary healthcare team; and (3) improved processes for connections, system navigation, and care delivery among interprofessional primary care teams, community service providers, and informal caregivers. The primary outcome will be the goal attainment scaling score. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy for managing chronic disease, quality of life, the participant perspective on their own aging, social support, access to health services, comprehensiveness of care, patient empowerment, patient-centeredness, caregiver strain, satisfaction with care, healthcare resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness. Implementation processes will also be evaluated. The main comparative analysis will take place at 6months. Discussion: Evidence of the individual elements of the Health TAPESTRY platform has been shown in isolation in the previous research. However, this study will better understand how to best integrate them to maximize the system's transformation of person-focused, primary care for older adults.

"Assessing Social Isolation: Pilot Testing Different Methods. Social isolation is a significant public health problem among many older adults; however, most of the empirical knowledge about isolation derives from community-based samples. There has been less attention given to isolation in senior housing communities. The objectives of this pilot study were to test two methods to identify socially isolated residents in low-income senior housing and compare findings about the extent of isolation from these two methods. The first method, self-report by residents, included 47 out of 135 residents who completed in-person interviews. To determine self-report isolation, residents completed the Lubben Social Network Scale 6 (LSNS-6). The second method involved a staff member who reported the extent of isolation on all 135 residents via an online survey. Results indicated that 26% of residents who were interviewed were deemed socially isolated by the LSNS-6. Staff members rated 12% of residents as having some or a lot of isolation. In comparing the two methods, staff members rated 2% of interviewed residents as having a lot of isolation. The combination of self-report and staff report could be more informative than just self-report alone, particularly when participation rates are low. However, researchers should be aware of the potential discrepancy between these two methods. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",1,0,0,0
"The Impact of Social Capital on Employees' Knowledge-Sharing Behavior: An Empirical Analysis of U.S. Federal Agencies. Recent critical challenges, including terrorism and an aging workforce, have brought to the attention of U.S. government agencies the need to share their knowledge across and within government organizations. In response to the growing awareness of knowledge sharing in the public sector, data from the Federal Human Capital Survey (FHCS) were utilized to develop and test a social-capital-theory-based extension of the relationship between social capital dimension and knowledge-sharing behavior by looking at the interaction effects between social capital dimensions and information technology (IT). The study also explores whether the social capital dimensions that affect knowledge sharing differ across three managerial levels (nonsupervisory, supervisory, and senior executive service). The findings provide insights and management strategies into social capital to stimulate knowledge sharing among employees in organizations.

"Let's spend some time together: Exploring the out-of-box experience of technology for older adults. Designing technology for older people has traditionally focused on compensating for the decline in abilities that occurs with ageing. The research described in this paper followed a more holistic approach, focusing on the broader user experience of technology in the home environment. Specifically, this research was concerned with the very first interactions with a new product known as the Out-of- Box Experience (OoBE): how older people acquire their technology, how they unpack it, and how they set it up. This paper describes two exploratory studies that used a design ethnography approach to build a rich picture of the OoBE of new technology for older adults. The findings indicate that older people experience varying benefits from the involvement of other people during the OoBE of new technology. Lastly, the paper discusses the value of social interaction in this context and offer recommendations on the design of the OoBE of technology to engage older adults. © 2016, IGI Global.",1,0,0,0
"Mobile application-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in an older adult. Introduction: Current evidence suggests potential efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in older adults. Mobile applications (apps) have been developed to facilitate CBT-I in the general population. However, because of deteriorating perceptual and cognitive functioning, the effectiveness of mobile apps in older adults remains unknown. Materials and Methods: This case report aims to demonstrate the utilization, advantages, and limitations of mobile app-assisted CBT-I in an older female adult. An app (""Win-Win aSleep"" [WWaS]) was applied in a six-session CBT-I treatment. Results: The patient successfully discontinued her hypnotics and had restored sleep quality after the intervention with WWaS-assisted CBT-I. Several limitations of WWaS were summarized, and pertinent approaches for enhancing future work were discussed. Conclusions: Mobile apps integrating wearable devices might overcome the difficulty for applying WWaS in older adults. In addition to tailored design of mobile technology for older adults, psychosocial support for the utilization of apps may not only enhance the compliance but also provide additional connection to the environment. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",1,0,0,1
"Helping Dementia Caregivers Through Technology. It is estimated there are between 43.5 and 65.7 million caregivers in the United States who provide unpaid care for older adults. Although the number of informal caregivers is expected to continue to increase, few programs have been established in home healthcare agencies to support these caregivers. This article describes a project that used a unique Web site to connect caregivers of people with dementia in a geographic region with an interprofessional group of healthcare providers and caregiver peers. Virtual Healthcare Neighborhood (VHN) was developed and maintained by an interprofessional group of healthcare providers from nursing, physical therapy, clinical counseling, and dental hygiene. The VHN provided weekly information on topics relevant to caring for a loved one with dementia at home as well as Question and Answer and Social Support Blogging sections for use by participants. This project was viewed as a positive and helpful method to provide support for caregivers of homebound older adults that could be easily replicated by home healthcare agencies.",0,0,0,0
"The use of common spaces in assisted living schemes for older persons: A comparison of somatic and dementia units. This study explores how common spaces in assisted living schemes for older persons are used by the residents. Observation studies, group interviews with staff and individual interviews with residents, relatives, architects and key stakeholders in the context of Swedish elder-care were conducted. Common spaces are the major location for in-house social interaction on the units. The results show a higher presence on the dementia units, compared to the somatic units. No significant correlation was found between the residents' mobility limitations and their degree of presence in the common spaces. The results also suggest a contradiction between the staff's intentions to provide a social context and the capabilities of the residents. Although common spaces are not used much between meals, the residents stress their importance for social interaction, suggesting that common spaces have important qualitative aspects, rather than quantitative. The results also show that few of the residents used the common spaces together with their relatives. The increasing use of assistive technology creates a shortage of space, suggesting a conflict between the efforts to create a home-like environment and the use of assistive technology.

"What is the mechanism effect that links social support to coping and psychological outcome within individuals affected by prostate cancer? Real time data collection using mobile technology. Purpose: Unmet support needs are prevalent in men affected by prostate cancer. Moreover, little is known about the optimal type of social support, or its mechanism effect between coping and emotional outcome in men affected by this disease to identify areas for clinical intervention. This study aimed to empirically test the propositions of social support theory in ""real time"" within individual men living with and beyond prostate cancer. Methods: Purposeful sub-sample from a larger prospective longitudinal study of prostate cancer survivors, took part in real time data collection using mobile technology. Self-reports were collected for 31 days prompted by an audio alarm 3 times per day (a total of 93 data entries) for each of the 12 case studies. Electronic data were analysed using time series analysis. Results: Majority of response rates were >90%. Men reported a lack of satisfaction with their support over time. Testing the propositions of social support theory ""within individuals"" over time demonstrated different results for main effect, moderation and mediation pathways that linked coping and social support to emotional outcome. For two men, negative effects of social support were identified. For six men the propositions of social support theory did not hold considering their within-person data. Conclusion: This innovative study is one of the first, to demonstrate the acceptability of e-health technology in an ageing population of men affected by prostate cancer. Collectively, the case series provided mixed support for the propositions of social support theory, and demonstrates that ""one size does not fit all"". © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,0,1
"Affective instability and the course of bipolar depression: Results from the STEP-BD randomised controlled trial of psychosocial treatment. Background: Little is known about predictors of recovery from bipolar depression. Aims: We investigated affective instability (a pattern of frequent and large mood shifts over time) as a predictor of recovery from episodes of bipolar depression and as a moderator of response to psychosocial treatment for acute depression. Method: A total of 252 out-patients with DSM-IV bipolar I or II disorder and who were depressed enrolled in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) and were randomised to one of three types of intensive psychotherapy for depression (n= 141) or a brief psychoeducational intervention (n =111). All analyses were by intention-to-treat. Results: Degree of instability of symptoms of depression and mania predicted a lower likelihood of recovery and longer time until recovery, independent of the concurrent effects of symptom severity. Affective instability did not moderate the effects of psychosocial treatment on recovery from depression. Conclusions: Affective instability may be a clinically relevant characteristic that influences the course of bipolar depression. Declaration of interest L.

"Age-related effects of job characteristics on burnout and work engagement. Background: In light of an ageing and age-diverse workforce, it is imperative to understand how psychosocial aspects of work might influence health throughout working life. Recently, there has been an implicit call to differentiate job characteristics beyond the two factors of job demands and job resources. As needs, abilities and motivation fluctuate with age, different job characteristics might yield differential benefits. Additionally, markers beyond chronological age should be considered. Aims: To explore systematically interactions between different job characteristics, age and age covariates (i.e. job tenure and position type) and their relationship with work-related health outcomes.Methods: An online survey of workers in Switzerland, Austria and Germany, recruited through a panel data service provider. We excluded participants working fewer than 30 hours a week, trainees, self-employed people and senior managers. We assessed seven areas of psychosocial risks at work, burnout, work engagement and demographics. Results: Of the 6000 workers contacted, 1916 responded (31%). After applying exclusion criteria, we analysed data from 1417 respondents. We found that age barely had a moderating effect between psychosocial factors and health outcomes, but its three-way interaction with age covariates had more explanatory potential. Young workers with high job tenure showed particular vulnerability to job demands and the lack of certain job resources. Older workers with managerial positions were more resilient. Conclusions: Age and its covariates, such as job tenure and position type, should be considered in developing age-sensitive occupational health models. © The Author 2016.

"Adherence to medical recommendations and treatments by elderly Patients: Usefil web services addressing this challenge. USEFIL is proposing an integrated system which will cope with ageing problem providing advanced, affordable and unobtrusive monitoring and web communication solutions for seniors living independently. Older adults face many challenges to their independence, often related to feeling loneliness, to a decline in mobility or cognition causing for example unintentional medication non-adherence. The ""adherence USEFIL system"" provides efficient and effective means of increased adherence to medical recommendations and treatments by elderly patients and thus extends the time that older people can live independently in their homes while limiting increases in public expenditure. This paper describes the design process of the services and apps of the ""adherence USEFIL system"". Aim of the paper is to demonstrate the use of the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) to design an ICT solution for increasing adherence to medical recommendations and treatments by elderly people. More specifically using the theoretical lens of the Design Science Research Methodology theory the paper presents the necessary steps that have been conducted to design the ""adherence USEFIL system"". Results demonstrate that the exploitation of 'off-the-shelf' consumer devices readily succeeds in meeting the study's initial objectives. © 2016 IEEE.",0,0,0,0
"Peripersonal and interpersonal space in virtual and real environments: Effects of gender and age. Proxemics and neuro-cognitive literature have suggested a close relationship between social and action functions of near-body space. Here we asked whether interpersonal-social (comfort distance) and peripersonal-action (reachability-distance) are similarly sensitive to social aspects. In an Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) study (Exp. 1), participants determined reachability and comfort distances from virtual male/female children, young/old adults while standing still (passive) or approaching them (active). Exp. 2 assessed the ecological validity of the IVR-study by replicating real participant-confederate interactions. Exp. 3 used a paper-and-pencil proxemics measure to investigate spatial behaviors for practical/clinical purposes. Results showed that reachability and comfort distances were similar in active but not passive, conditions. Both distances were moderated by gender (reduction with females; expansion with males) and age (expansion with adults; reduction with children). These results were consistent among the three approaches. Therefore, interpersonal and peripersonal spaces share a common motor nature and are similarly sensitive to social aspects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",0,0,0,0
"Military parents' personal technology usage and interest in e-health information for obesity prevention. Background: U.S. military families are experiencing high obesity rates similar to the civilian population. The Department of Defense's Military Health System (MHS) is one of the largest healthcare providers in the United States, serving approximately 9.2 million active duty service members, retirees, spouses, and children. The annual cost to the MHS for morbidities associated with being overweight exceeds $1 billion. The preschool age has been suggested as an opportune time to intervene for the prevention of obesity. Thus, this study investigated the current level of technology usage by military service member families and assessed their needs and interests in health/nutrition information. This needs assessment is crucial for researchers/educators to design further studies and intervention programs for obesity prevention in military families with young children. Materials and Methods: In total, 288 military parents (233 Army and 55 Air Force) at two military bases whose children were enrolled in military childcare centers in the southwestern United States participated in a Technology Usage in Military Family (TUMF) survey in 2013. Results and Conclusions: Overall, both bases presented similar technology usage patterns in terms of computer and mobile device usage on the Internet. Air Force base parents had a slightly higher knowledge level of nutrition/health information than Army base parents. The TUMF survey suggested practical ways such as mobile applications/Web sites, social networks, games, etc., that health educators can use to disseminate nutrition/health information for obesity prevention among military families with young children. © 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",0,0,0,1
"Cognitive stimulation of the default-mode network modulates functional connectivity in healthy aging. A cognitive-stimulation tool was created to regulate functional connectivity within the brain Default-Mode Network (DMN). Computerized exercises were designed based on the hypothesis that repeated task-dependent coactivation of multiple DMN regions would translate into regulation of resting-state network connectivity. Forty seniors (mean age: 65.90 years; SD: 8.53) were recruited and assigned either to an experimental group (n = 21) who received one month of intensive cognitive stimulation, or to a control group (n = 19) who maintained a regime of daily-life activities explicitly focused on social interactions. An MRI protocol and a battery of neuropsychological tests were administered at baseline and at the end of the study. Changes in the DMN (measured via functional connectivity of posterior-cingulate seeds), in brain volumes, and in cognitive performance were measured with mixed models assessing group-by-timepoint interactions. Moreover, regression models were run to test gray-matter correlates of the various stimulation tasks. Significant associations were found between task performance and gray-matter volume of multiple DMN core regions. Training-dependent up-regulation of functional connectivity was found in the posterior DMN component. This interaction was driven by a pattern of increased connectivity in the training group, while little or no up-regulation was seen in the control group. Minimal changes in brain volumes were found, but there was no change in cognitive performance. The training-dependent regulation of functional connectivity within the posterior DMN component suggests that this stimulation program might exert a beneficial impact in the prevention and treatment of early AD neurodegeneration, in which this neurofunctional pathway is progressively affected by the disease. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",1,1,1,0

"A feasibility study of virtual reality exercise in elderly patients with hematologic malignancies receiving chemotherapy. Objective Adherence to rehabilitation exercise is much lower in patients with hematologic malignancies (22.5-45.8%) than in patients with solid tumors (60-85%) due to the administration of more intensive chemotherapeutic regimens in the former. Virtual reality exercise can be performed even in a biological clean room and it may improve the adherence rates in elderly patients with hematologic malignancies. Thus, in this pilot study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of virtual reality exercise intervention using Nintendo Wii Fit in patients with hematologic malignancies receiving chemotherapy. Methods In this feasibility study, 16 hospitalized patients with hematologic malignancies aged ≥60 years performed virtual reality exercise for 20 minutes using the Nintendo Wii Fit once a day, five times a week, from the start of chemotherapy until hospital discharge. The adherence rate, safety, and physical and psychological performances were assessed. Results The adherence rate for all 16 patients was 66.5%. Nine patients completed the virtual reality exercise intervention with 88 sessions, and the adherence rate was 62.0%. No intervention-related adverse effects >Grade 2, according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0, were observed. We noted maintenance of the physical performance (e.g., Barthel index, handgrip strength, knee extension strength, one-leg standing time, and the scores of timed up and go test and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living) and psychosocial performance (e.g., score of hospital anxiety and depression scale). Conclusion Virtual reality exercise using the Wii Fit may be feasible, safe and efficacious, as demonstrated in our preliminary results, for patients with hematologic malignancies receiving chemotherapy. © 2016 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.",1,1,1,1
"Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place. Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.",1,0,0,1
"Does income relate to health due to psychosocial or material factors? Consistent support for the psychosocial hypothesis requires operationalization with income rank not the Yitzhaki Index. Research on why income influences health has produced mixed findings. Many, but not all, studies suggest that the relationship between income and health is due to income indicating psychosocial position rather than the associated material benefits. The inconsistent findings may be partly due to the use of the Yitzhaki Index, a function which calculates the accumulated income shortfall for an individual relative to those with higher income, in order to represent the psychosocial position conferred by income. The current study tests whether an alternative specification - income rank - provides more consistent conclusions regarding the psychosocial effect of income on health. We used data from two nationally representative samples: 14,224 observations from 9,404 participants across three waves (2004, 2008, and 2012) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and 29,237 observations from 8,441 individuals across seven waves (2007-2013) of the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS). Multilevel regression models indicated that income rank was a stronger and more consistent predictor than both the Yitzhaki Index and actual income of self-rated and objective health. The psychosocial hypothesis is more consistently supported when income rank is used to test it. © 2015 .",0,0,0,0
"Prolonged grief symptoms related to loss of physical functioning: Examining unique associations with medical service utilization. Purpose: Prolonged grief, a severe and chronic form of grieving most commonly studied in the context of bereavement, may have relevance to losses associated with chronic illness (e.g. grief related to loss of functioning or loss of a planned future). The purpose of the present study is to examine the unique associations between prolonged grief symptoms and service utilization patterns. Methods: An online self-report assessment battery was administered among a sample of 275 older adults with at least one chronic illness that caused significant physical impairment. Results: Even after statistically controlling for relevant physical health (e.g. severity of physical limitations, somatic symptoms, number of chronic illnesses) and psychosocial variables (e.g. social support, depression/anxiety), more severe prolonged grief symptoms were associated with a greater number of emergency room visits, overnight stays in the hospital and total nights in the hospital. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of screening for prolonged grief symptomatology with older individuals with a debilitating chronic illness.Implications for RehabilitationRecent evidence suggests that prolonged grief may have relevance for losses associated with physical illness.The present study shows that prolonged grief reactions related to physical illness (e.g. grieving the loss of functioning) are uniquely associated with increased hospital-based service utilization.Given the relevance of prolonged grief reactions in this population, practitioners may wish to assess for these symptoms.Future clinical research should focus on developing interventions to target prolonged grief symptoms associated with these losses. © 2015 Informa UK Ltd.",1,0,0,1
"Computer and Internet Literacy in Older Age. Computer and Internet technology is a potential source of valuable general as well as health information and plays an increasing role in our everyday lives. The main objective or this study was to evaluate the use of computer and the Internet among older people. The study was conducted by the National Institute of Gerontology and Geriatrics ""Ana Aslan"" over a period of 6 months in 2015. A number of 455 participants 65 years of age and older were asked to complete a 16 items questionnaire inquiring about the use of computer and the Internet. Approximately one in three people were computer and Internet users. Factors the significantly affected computer as well as Internet use were age, level of education, income and social isolation. The majority of non-users indicated that specific training and better financial conditions would stimulate future computer and Internet use. This finding was consistent with reported reasons for not using the Internet, specifically lack of knowledge and considerable degree of difficulty. © 2015 IEEE.",1,0,0,0
"Street characteristics preferred for transportation walking among older adults: A choice-based conjoint analysis with manipulated photographs. Background: Knowledge about the relationships between micro-scale environmental factors and older adults' walking for transport is limited and inconsistent. This is probably due to methodological limitations, such as absence of an accurate neighborhood definition, lack of environmental heterogeneity, environmental co-variation, and recall bias. Furthermore, most previous studies are observational in nature. We aimed to address these limitations by investigating the effects of manipulating photographs on micro-scale environmental factors on the appeal of a street for older adults' transportation walking. Secondly, we used latent class analysis to examine whether subgroups could be identified that have different environmental preferences for transportation walking. Thirdly, we investigated whether these subgroups differed in socio-demographic, functional and psychosocial characteristics, current level of walking and environmental perceptions of their own street. Methods: Data were collected among 1131 Flemish older adults through an online (n=940) or an interview version of the questionnaire (n=191). This questionnaire included a choice-based conjoint exercise with manipulated photographs of a street. These manipulated photographs originated from one panoramic photograph of an existing street that was manipulated on nine environmental attributes. Participants chose which of two presented streets they would prefer to walk for transport. Results: In the total sample, sidewalk evenness had by far the greatest appeal for transportation walking. The other environmental attributes were less important. Four subgroups that differed in their environmental preferences for transportation walking were identified. In the two largest subgroups (representing 86% of the sample) sidewalk evenness was the most important environmental attribute. In the two smaller subgroups (each comprising 7% of the sample), traffic volume and speed limit were the most important environmental attributes for one, and the presence of vegetation and a bench were the most important environmental attributes for the other. This latter subgroup included a higher percentage of service flat residents than the other subgroups. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the provision of even sidewalks should be considered a priority when developing environmental interventions aiming to stimulate older adults' transportation walking. Natural experiments are needed to confirm whether our findings can be translated to real environments and actual transportation walking behavior. © 2016 Van Cauwenberg et al.",1,0,0,1
"Aging and Transgender Bisexuals: Exploring the Intersection of Age, Bisexual Sexual Identity, and Transgender Identity. This study is the first to examine the experiences and needs of an international sample of current, English-speaking, bisexual, and transgender-identified adults (trans-bisexuals) on a number of later-life and end-of-life (EOL) perceptions, preparations, and concerns. In particular, the author analyzed a subset (n = 147) of the cross-sectional data collected from the online Trans MetLife Survey on Later-Life Preparedness and Perceptions in Transgender-Identified Individuals (N = 1,963). The author assessed perceptions and fears around aging, preparation for later life and end of life, as well as numerous demographic and psychosocial variables. Despite the fact that many respondents feel that they have aged successfully, the respondent trans-bisexual population harbors significant fears around later life challenges. Additionally the author found that this population is ill prepared for the major legalities and events that occur in the later to end-of-life time periods. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1,0,0,0
"Inferring social isolation in older adults through ambient intelligence and social networking sites. Early diagnosis of social isolation in older adults can prevent physical and cognitive impairment or further impoverishment of their social network. This diagnosis is usually performed by personal and periodic application of psychological assessment instruments. This situation encourages the development of novel approaches able to monitor risk situations in social interactions to obtain early diagnosis and implement appropriate measures. This paper presents the development of a prediction model of social isolation in older adults through Ambient Intelligence (AmI) and Social Networking Sites (SNSs). The predictive model has been evaluated in terms of its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, predictive values. This paper also presents the results of an experimental test applying the proposed approach with real users, obtaining a prediction accuracy of 87% and a type II error rate of 15%. The proposed model will benefit institutions interested in developing technological solutions to detect early stages of social isolation, resulting in improving the quality of life of older adults.",1,0,0,0
"Different Types of Sedentary Activities and Their Association with Perceived Health and Wellness among Middle-Aged and Older Adults: A Cross-Sectional Analysis. Purpose: To assess the association between a variety of sedentary activities and self-reported wellness outcomes to provide a comprehensive perspective for future development of sedentary guidelines for middle-aged and older adults. Design: Cross-sectional population study. Setting: Canadian Community Health Survey (Healthy Aging Cycle, 2008-2009). Subjects: Middle-aged (45-60 years; n = 8161) and older adults (60 years and older; n = 9128) were used for analysis. Measures: Self-reported perceived health, sense of belonging to community, mood disorder, and satisfaction with life were used as outcomes. Sedentary activities were playing bingo, computer use, doing crosswords/puzzles, handicrafts, listening to radio/music, playing a musical instrument, reading, visiting others, and watching TV. Analysis: Chi-squares, t-tests and multivariable logistic regressions. Results: Among respondents not diagnosed with a mood disorder, positive associations were noted for crosswords/puzzles in older adults (odds ratio [OR]: 1.39, confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.91) and listening to radio/music or playing an instrument in middle-aged adults (OR: 1.43, CI: 1.16-1.75; OR: 2.14, CI: 1.17-3.81). Satisfaction with life was positively associated with computer use in middle-aged (OR: 1.53, CI: 1.07-2.20) and older adults (OR: 1.42, CI: 1.09-1.84). Sense of belonging was consistently positively associated with sedentary activities. Conclusion: Several sedentary activities were found to be positively associated with self-reported measures of psychosocial wellness in middle-aged and older adults. These findings identify potential opportunities for sedentary time interventions and dual-task physical activity promotion. © The Author(s) 2016.",0,0,0,1

"An Administrator's Perspective on the Organization of Physical Activity for Older Adults in Long-Term Care Facilities. Background: The positive influence of physical activity (PA) on health is well documented. Even at old age, PA remains useful but participation in PA decreases with age. In long-term care facilities (LTCFs), PA appears to be reduced to a bare minimum. Because administrators have a key role in developing the care policy of LTCFs, it is important that they support the organization of PA in LTCFs. Objective: The main objective of this mixed-method study was to identify motivators and barriers for organizing PA in LTCFs according to administrators. A secondary goal was to examine the knowledge of the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines regarding PA and to reveal potential motivators and barriers for the implementation of the guidelines. Methods: First, 24 administrators completed semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed using the deductive approach of qualitative content analysis. The obtained motivators and barriers were categorized on 3 different levels (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community) according to the socioecological model by 2 independent reviewers; conflicts were resolved with a third researcher. Next, 127 administrators of Flemish (Belgium) LTCFs completed an online questionnaire survey containing open-ended, unique, and multiple choice questions regarding the LTCFs, PA, and the WHO guidelines, as well as statements (scored on a 5-point Likert scale) regarding perceived motivators and barriers for organizing PA sessions in the LTCF. Results: In the qualitative component, the administrators reported 31 motivators and 24 barriers for organizing PA in the LTCF. In the survey, maintaining or enhancing general health of the residents (98%) and improving the psychological well-being of the residents were marked as key motivators at the intrapersonal level. The administrators (97%) were convinced that PA is a useful way to spend time for LTCF residents. Encouraging social contact (94%) and countering loneliness (86%) are the motivators cited at the interpersonal level. At the community level, the infrastructure of the facility (91%) and adequate and sufficient material (88%) are the main motivators. The barriers that were presented to the participants were scored as less important. The majority of the administrators (83%) are not familiar with the WHO guidelines for PA; 70% of the participants believe that the guidelines are useful, but only 40% is convinced that it is realistic to implement the guidelines in an LTCF. Conclusions: This study described different motivators and barriers for administrators to organize PA in LTCFs. Contrary to other studies, lack of staff, lack of adequate equipment, and lack of financial resources were rejected as potential barriers for organizing PA. Despite the fact that administrators were not familiar with the WHO guidelines for PA, they believed that the guidelines are useful. The participants reported several barriers for implementation of the guidelines. Administrators of LTCFs are motivated to implement the guidelines if PA can be integrated in daily activities and education of LTCF staff regarding PA is provided. © 2016 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",0,0,0,1
"A tale of two divides: Technology experiences among racially and socioeconomically diverse older adults. Using information and communication technologies (ICTs) can improve older adults’ overall well-being and can be a catalyst for social integration and inclusion into society. While older adults are often compared to other age cohorts, based on previous digital divide research, there may be a significant amount of variation within older adult populations with regards to their ICT experiences, attitudes, and uses. Our study seeks to explore the potential gap by examining and comparing ICT uses, views, and experiences among older adults from diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Four semi-structured focus groups (n = 40) were conducted with older adults from two separate cities in Mid-Michigan in the United States: Greater Lansing area and Detroit. Our findings reveal that older adults’ experiences, uses, and perceptions about ICTs differ down racial and socio-economic lines.

"Real relationships in a virtual world: Social engagement among older adults in Second Life. Background This study examined Second Life (SL), a 3D immersive environment, as an opportunity for older adults to create new social relationships. Method A total of 39 adults aged 60 and older (86.8% female, 13.2% male) completed the study. Outside of the weekly, two-hour formal instruction time, they spent a minimum of 20 hours in SL over the course of two weeks. Semi-structured in-person interviews were conducted with each participant to explore their attitudes toward and perceptions of online relationships; their experiences interacting with others in SL and the degree to which they formed relationships; and the challenges they encountered in creating these relationships. Results & discussion We found that older adults were largely receptive to the possibility of creating online relationships, but only a minority of them were successful in establishing them. A number of challenges to creating these relationships are discussed. This study suggests that SL may offer social benefits to a subset of older adults; however, simpler platforms should be explored to reduce challenges in navigating online environments.",1,1,1,1
"Prevalence of depression among older adults-results from the well-being of the Singapore elderly study. Introduction: Depression is a significant public health issue across all sociodemographic groups and is identified as a common and serious mental health problem particularly among the older adult population. The aims of the current study were to determine the prevalence of depression and subsyndromal depression among older adults in Singapore. Materials and Methods: The Well-being of the Singapore Elderly (WiSE) study was a comprehensive single phase, cross-sectional survey. Stage 1 Geriatric Mental State-Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy (GMS-AGECAT) depression syndrome was used for this analysis. Association of depression and subsyndromal depression with sociodemographic characteristics, social support as well as comorbidity with chronic physical illnesses and quality of life was assessed. Results: The prevalence of GMS-AGECAT depression and subsyndromal depression was 3.7% and 13.4%, respectively. The odds of depression were significantly higher among those aged 75 to 84 (2.1) as compared to those aged 60 to 74 years and in those who had a history of depression diagnosis by a doctor (4.1). The odds of depression were higher among those of Indian and Malay ethnicities (5.2 and 3.2 times, respectively) as compared to those of Chinese ethnicity. Those with depression and subsyndromal depression were associated with more disability, poorer life satisfaction, and medical comorbidities. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the prevalence of depression seems to have decreased as compared to a decade ago wherein the prevalence of depression was estimated to be 5.5%. This positive trend can be ascribed to concerted efforts across various disciplines and sectors, which need to be continually strengthened, monitored and evaluated. © 2016, Academy of Medicine Singapore.

"Online group-exercises for older adults of different physical abilities. In this paper we describe the design and validation of a virtual fitness environment aiming at keeping older adults physically and socially active. We target particularly older adults who are socially more isolated, physically less active, and with less chances of training in a gym. The virtual fitness environment, namely Gymcentral, was designed to enable and motivate older adults to follow personalised exercises from home, with a (heterogeneous) group of remote friends and under the remote supervision of a Coach. We take the training activity as an opportunity to create social interactions, by complementing training features with social instruments. Finally, we report on the feasibility and effectiveness of the virtual environment, as well as its effects on the usage and social interactions, from an intervention study in Trento, Italy. © 2016 IEEE.",1,1,1,0
"Efficacy of a digital education program on Life Satisfaction and digital self efficacy in older adults: A mixed method study. People aged 65 and over often have difficulties in interacting with ICTs, even though these technologies are considered to be essential in ageing healthily, as they allow people to maintain their communicative and cognitive abilities and their social relationships even when the former biologically decline and the latter are difficult to keep up as mobility slowly becomes more challenging. This research aims to explore the efficacy of a 6 class Digital Education program in improving digital self efficacy (tablet use) and life satisfaction in people aged 65 and over, using a quali-quantitative longitudinal design (measurements taken after the first class - T1 - and after the last one -T2). Quantitative phase sample consists in 130 65 y.o. and over participants, ethnographical sample is a 10 person class, all attending a digital education program.

"Moving beyond mood: Is it time to recommend cognitive training for depression in older adults?. Major depression is often associated with neuropsychological defi cits, most commonly in the areas of executive functioning (e.g. set-shifting, problem-solving, decision-making), information processing speed, new learning and memory. These cognitive defi cits may be even more pronounced in older adults with depression and particularly in those with cardiovascular risk factors, where cognitive impairment is linked with multiple pathophysiologies including white matter lesions and alterations in key grey matter brain structures. In this group, underlying neurodegenerative pathology is also an important consideration. Of concern, cognitive defi cits are predictive of treatment responsiveness and may persist despite depressive symptom resolution. However, most traditional treatments for depression (i.e. antidepressants and psychological therapies) do not focus on cognition. By contrast, cognitive training is a novel non-pharmacological therapy that may be used to directly target cognition and psychosocial functioning, by promoting neural plasticity. In this chapter, we review the evidence for cognitive training in depression with additional reference to work in healthy samples and those with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease. Studies using both computer-based and strategy-based training approaches are discussed. To date, there is a lack of well-controlled studies utilising cognitive training for people with depression. Nonetheless, 13 studies employing computer-based cognitive training programs reveal promising results, particularly for improving memory and mood. Further randomised controlled trials in those with depression are now required, to examine the potential magnitude of cognitive improvement and to determine which individual, clinical and treatment-related factors may influence treatment efficacy. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

With an ageing society, it is desirable to develop senior-friendly innovations to empower older adults to lead enjoyable and fulfilling lives. This study examines ageing issues of older adults in Singapore and their coping strategies through adoption and appropriation of technology in the form of smartphones and wearable devices. Data was collected through in-depth interviews (10 participants) and focus groups (26 participants in 4 groups). Health problems, financial difficulties, loneliness and security concerns were the major ageing –related issues emerged from our analysis. The current status of technology use, adoption barriers and desired functions are discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",1,0,0,0
"Elder adults utilizing social networking sites on mobile platforms. Although social media and mobile technologies are trending topics, only a small amount of elder adults utilizes these Web 2.0 technologies on portable platforms. To gain a better understanding of the current state of elder adults utilizing social media on mobile devices, a literature review regarding mobile interface design guidelines is presented. To further investigate the lack of mobile social media users, a usability study addressing social media interfaces for elders is proposed. The goal of this research is to have elder adults more comfortable using social media on mobile devices so that they can reap the benefits of these types of sites. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",1,0,0,0
"Validating elder adults' social networking sites use - A study based on Facebook. In the rapidly aging society of Taiwan, keeping interpersonal interaction with others becomes an increasingly important issue to elder adults. None or little social interaction with others causes psychological problems in elder adults' general life. With the development of information communication technology (ICT), the use of social networking sites for interpersonal interaction thus has emerging importance. Nevertheless, elder adults' may not be able to accept the use of such sites for social interaction for the late appearance of the technology in their life. This study is therefore motivated to explore elder adults' use of Facebook for social interaction based on TAM2. Data of 120 valid respondents were gathered and analysed with PLS. The results showed that perceived use anxiety significantly decreased elder adults' acceptance of social networking site for social interaction although friends' use and family's use motivated their usage. Furthermore, perceived social usefulness was not shown of significant impact on their usage. The results demonstrated the importance of others' use and the reduction of use anxiety in elder adults' acceptance of social networking sites as a way to reach others and to keep themselves socially relevant to others.",1,0,0,0
"Helping others use social media: Age stereotypes when estimating learner's success. Social networking sites (SNS) include online products such as Facebook that allow users to build and maintain large interpersonal Internet networks. Older adult users have dramatically increased (Duggan & Smith, 2014). This investigation examined how 212 university undergraduate Facebook users estimated success with helping others use Facebook when learner's age (20, 40, 60 year olds.) and type of acquaintance (friend or kin) was manipulated in hypothetical scenarios. In these scenarios, a person is identified as KW, described as being a college student much like the participant. KW has 20, 40 or 60 year-old acquaintances, a friend or a kin at each age, all wanting KW's help learning about social media. This was the only information provided. Qualities and strengths of these interpersonal relationships were not examined. Results from repeated measures 2x3 ANOVA showed a significant main effect for age, but no effect for acquaintance type. Results showed no significant interaction. Although the age demographic above 50 years is the fastest growing SNS group, results showed possible age stereotyping among youth when they assist older adults learning to use SNS. This age effect may be lessened as older adults become more skillful social media users. These findings are limited because of the sample demographics and a lack of identifying qualities of participants' attributions about the hypothetical friends or relatives. Future research using multiple items per condition might be able to further elucidate how the type of associations between helper and learner, close or distant, positive or negative, would influence outcomes. © Psychology, Society, & Education, 2016.",0,0,0,0
"An information-centric framework for mobile collaboration between seniors and caregivers that balances independence, privacy, and social connectedness. Participating in intellectually and socially complex activities provides cognitive benefits to older adults [9]. Socially engaged seniors tend to live longer [8], experience fewer depressive symptoms, self-report lower disability levels, and demonstrate higher levels of cognitive function [1] and lower incidence rates of dementia [3]. However, as complexity of knowledge, size of caregiver circle, and reliance on computers are all increasing, seniors need to maintain their sense of control and independence in their information-centered activities, as well as be able to access reliable trusted information sources. Therefore, our research goal is to develop a theoretical framework for intelligent assistive technologies that provide information-managing support and autonomy to older adults while alleviating the burden on caregivers. This framework will be tested and deployed as a collaborative mobile tool that facilitates information seeking and sharing, increases seniors’ confidence in the information presented, and satisfies their need of privacy and independence. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",0,0,0,0
"Understanding mobile SNS usage for aging people in China: A perspective from motivations, trust and attitude. The aim of this research is to investigate the determinants of Chinese older adults in the use of the social network service (SNS). Qualitative and semi structure analysis were applied to understand what factors encourage or discourage older adults use WeChat, a most frequently used SNS in China. Our findings show a digital divide: the number of the older people used WeChat is far less than that of teenagers and young generation. Even those who used WeChat, they tend to use a small part of functions within WeChat. The survey demonstrated that psychological motivations such as sociality need, information exchange and entertainment had positive effects on older adults’ attitudes. The level of WeChat usage in the context of aging is influenced by the following major themes: usage purpose and motivation, social influence, physical fitness requirements and self efficacy. For those users who have experienced WeChat, most have positive attitude toward WeChat. Security concerns and perceived cost are not strong negative factors impeding on the older adult using the WeChat but how they use the functions provided by WeChat. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",1,0,0,0
"Mental activation of seniors incorporating ICT in their daily lives. This paper aims to know the impact of the use of computers in everyday life for older adults. The results of the investigation confirm that seniors were not prepared to deal with information and communication technologies, moreover, that many of them are not active in the technological society, creating feelings of loneliness, fear and ignorance. The aim of the study was to determine the changes in mood and mindset to incorporate older adults today’s technological society through a process of learning of ICT.

"Internet use and self-reported psychosocial health: Applying a more nuanced approach when studying a Finnish population sample. Objective In the present study, the role of Internet use in relation to self-reported psychosocial health among Finnish older adults is explored, looking at associations between Internet use for different purposes and three health dimensions. Methods This study is based on population survey data of 1097 respondents aged 65 to 80 years old, who were Internet users and non-users, respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed, comparing emotional, social and physical health status (based on items from the Short Form Health Survey, SF-12) between Internet users and respondents not using the Internet. Also, a post hoc multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed. Results Internet use was associated with emotional health status (OR 0.58 (0.39-0.86), 95%CI), but not physical or social health status when controlling for socio-demographic variables. More specifically, respondents using the Internet for hobby or entertainment (OR 1.68 (1.02-2.76), 95%CI) and work or study purposes (OR 2.37 (1.03-5.49), 95%CI) exhibited a better emotional health status than respondents not using the Internet. Conclusions Results add to the growing body of research emphasizing the need for increased focus on evolving societal determinants which may complicate, support or protect the psychosocial health of older individuals. The specific study findings should be further explored for causality, in order to discern whether they may constitute a useable mechanism when designing Internet initiatives for digital inclusion or mental health promotion aimed at older adults.",1,0,0,1
"Treatment Implications in a Geriatric Schizophrenia Patient with Hoarding. Severe hoarding is associated with a number of health and safety risks, such as fire hazards and health code violations. Older adults in particular are vulnerable to the consequences of hoarding, including malnutrition, medication mismanagement, and social isolation. We describe the case of a 69-year-old woman with established chronic schizophrenia and hoarding disorder. This patient was removed from her apartment by the Mobile Crisis Team and the Police Department for psychiatric evaluation and treatment after she was found exhibiting bizarre behavior in a pest-infested apartment filled with debris and old furniture, placing herself and her neighbors in danger. Treatment challenges posed by these complicated patients alongside safety and legal implications are discussed. © 2016 Hogrefe.",1,0,0,0
"Health related quality of life among elderly living in region of high vulnerability for health in belo horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil [Qualidade de vida relacionada à saúde em idosos residentes em região de alta vulnerabilidade para saúde de belo horizonte, Minas Gerais]. Objective: To investigate whether social relations, sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and health conditions are associated with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among elderly persons living in regions classified as high vulnerable in terms of health. Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted with a population-based random sample of 366 elderly (≥ 60 years of age) persons registered at a primary healthcare unit in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. HRQOL was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) and the scores obtained in the physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS) were our response variables. Social relations, sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and health conditions were considered our groups of explanatory variables. Multiple linear regression models were used for the analysis. Results: In the final multivariate models, we found that elevated number of diagnosis of chronic diseases, and being bedridden for the last 15 days were variables associated with worse PCS and MCS. However, lack of education, dissatisfaction with personal relationships, lack of support and help when bedridden or to go to the doctor, and to prepare meals were associated with worse HRQOL only in MCS. Participants who reported black race/color, absence of work activity, lack of physical activity, no alcohol consumption, and hospitalization in the last 12 months had worse HRQOL only in PCS. Conclusion: In addition to the aspects related to social adversity, lifestyle, and health conditions, some functional aspects of social relations were important for understanding the HRQOL in elderly persons living in social vulnerability. © 2016, Assocaicao Brasileira de Pos, Gradacao em Saude Coletiva.

"Quality of life and active aging through educational gerontology in information technology and communication. This research was conducted through action research; was through training course information technologies to incorporate into the daily life of an older adult use computers. The sample consisted of 20 elderly who participate in a course designed low assumptions of gerontology, which is the science that studies the changes in old age and during aging. The study was justified because most seniors are not prepared to deal with these technologies and as a result many of them are not active in the technological society, this creates feelings of loneliness, fear, ignorance and forgetfulness, among others. In addition, there is a profound shift in values and social attitudes, changes capable of causing a major rift between young people and their ancestors. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the inclusion of the elderly to today’s technological society, through the process of learning technologies in Baja California, México. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",1,0,0,0
"Competitive vs affiliative design of immersive VR exergames. Virtual reality (VR) can provide compelling experiences which might enhance users’ engagement with physical activity. Despite the known health benefits of exergaming, there is a limited understanding of how various game designs impact user experience. This work proposes VR Rides, a virtual reality exergaming platform that combines a recumbent tricycle, real-world panoramic images, an Oculus Rift headset and a Microsoft Kinect camera, where the player can navigate real locations in a safe virtual environment. We further compare two game designs: a competitive guessing game and affiliative tour. This pilot study with both young and older adults indicates that task enjoyment (r = 0.721, p = 0.000), motivation (r = 0.565, p = 0.009) and connectedness (r = 0.697, p = 0.001) is higher in the competitive variant. Participants in both variants were highly engaged, likely due to the use of immersive VR. Descriptive analysis suggests that participants showed similar connectedness in affiliative tour (63%) and competitive design (62%). © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",0,0,0,0
"Frailty and its association with rehabilitation outcomes in a post-acute older setting. Background/Aims: Frailty is highly prevalent in hospitalised older adults and is a predictor of dependency, length of stay, institutionalisation and mortality. The concept of frailty and its interaction with disability and psychosocial functioning has been well established in community-based studies. However, its association with outcomes in hospitalised older adults is less understood. This study gives the clinician a greater understanding of the impact of frailty on rehabilitation outcomes by evaluating the changes in physical function, quality of life and falls self-efficacy in frail older adults undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. A secondary aim was to examine the association between frailty, physical function, quality of life, falls self-efficacy, therapy time, length of stay and discharge destination. Methods: This prospective cohort study assessed 41 subjects (mean age 80.3 ± 7.1 years) admitted to an inpatient post-acute rehabilitation unit. Eligible participants must have been aged 65 years or older and mobile pre-admission. The primary outcome measure was the Timed Up and Go test. Secondary measures included the Clinical Frailty Scale, grip strength, 10-Metre Walk Test, Elderly Mobility Scale, Tinetti Balance and Gait Test, Barthel Index, EuroQol-5D Visual Analogue Scale and Falls Efficacy Scale. These were assessed by the multidisciplinary team on admission and at discharge. Time spent in therapy, discharge destination and length of stay were also recorded on discharge. Results: Statistically significant improvements were found in physical function, quality of life and falls self-efficacy. Moderate and strong correlations were found between admission scores on the Clinical Frailty Scale, Timed Up and Go (r=0.438, p<0.0004), gait speed (r=0.408, p<0.009), Tinetti Balance and Gait Test (r=–0.489, p<0.001) and Elderly Mobility Scale (r=–0.5, p<0.001). Moderate correlations were also found between admission Clinical Frailty Scale and therapy time and length of stay (median 35 days). Regression analysis was performed on admission frailty scores adjusting for age, gender, number of co-morbidities, Mini Mental State Examination and mobility level and found that admission Clinical Frailty Scale scores were predictive of mobility markers, dependency and length of stay. Conclusions: Frailty on admission had a moderate relationship with determinants of physical function, therapy time and length of stay. Further research investigating the validity of frailty measures is required before frailty can be validly utilised as an outcome for elderly rehabilitation. © 2016 MA Healthcare Ltd.",1,1,1,1
"Older people’s use and learning of new media: A case study on remote rural villages in Finnish Lapland. People aged 65+ generally use new media technologies less, in less mobile ways, and for less versatile purposes than younger age groups do. This has raised concerns about older people’s potential exclusion from the digital society. In this paper we present a case study on how older people, who were living in small rural villages in Finnish Lapland, use new media in their everyday lives. According to the participants, how do they use new media in their everyday lives? How do they learn to use new media? Our results point to the diversity in terms of the participants’ self-reported Internet use and related skills. The results also indicate that the participants’ social networks, especially grandchildren, play a more important role in their use of and learning about new media technologies than formal instruction does. Therefore, it is important to recognize that older people who lack social networks are most vulnerable in terms of being excluded from the digital society. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",1,0,0,0
"Exploring the relationship between computer proficiency and computer use over time in the PRISM trial. The aim of the PRISM trial was to examine the potential benefits of a Personal Reminder Information and Social Management (PRISM) computer system on the well-being and perceived social support of an older adult sample at risk for social isolation. Participants (N = 300) were randomly assigned to receive the PRISM system, which was designed to support social connections, information gathering, prospective memory, and access to local and national resources, or a binder that contained similar information. The intervention lasted one year, and the computer usage of the PRISM group was monitored. This trial represented a unique opportunity to explore potential barriers to the adoption and continued use of information and communications technologies. Specifically, this paper explored the relationship between computer proficiency and use of the PRISM system over time. Contrary to what one might predict, participants with initially low proficiency used the system more over the course of the trial (r(123) = −.22, p <.05). The fact that even those with the lowest levels or proficiency were able to become among the most active PRISM users may reflect that the system was designed well for older adult computer novices (the intended target of the intervention). Over the course of the trial, participants assigned to the PRISM condition improved substantially in their computer proficiency. Increased computer proficiency from baseline to 12 months was a much strong predictor of system use (r(123) =.53, p <.001), possibly reflecting increased proficiency as a result of greater use over time. Overall, data suggest a complex relationship between computer use, computer proficiency, and changes in computer proficiency over time worthy of additional exploration to further understand the effects of, and barriers to, the use of information and communications technologies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",1,1,1,0
"Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument. Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",1,0,0,1
"Using information and communication technologies to promote healthy aging in Costa Rica: Challenges and opportunities. Several authors have suggested that ICTs have the potential to promote healthy ageing by supporting social inclusion, access to products and services and learning. However, older people often do not use ICT and information about patterns of usage is scarce. Data from the Costa Rica Census 2011 and two questionnaires showed that older people between 65 and 74 years old, living in urban areas, with more education and higher socioeconomic status are the most active ICT users. They presented a tendency to mobility and connectivity when using ICTs, reported positive perceptions of technology and were favorably disposed to learning about and using ICT. Based on the analysis of data we conclude that opportunities to promote healthy aging through use of ICT include use of public infrastructure and community-based learning services to increase the number of ICT users and facilitate progression from social networking activities to activities supporting the maximization of functional status such as instrumental activities and learning for personal development. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",1,0,0,0

"Getting to the root of the problem: Informing design through the exploration of the gardening experience of older women. Gardening is a leisure activity that can be beneficial for both health and wellbeing of older women. Although the ageing process can provide more challenges for this group, adaptation of the activities and the tools will allow them to continue the beneficial activities. To explore the gardening experience of an older female (50+) target group and focus on their perception of the various different tasks, this online survey-based research included a range of different gardening tasks and the motivations for doing gardening activities. Participants (N=89) answered 38 questions regarding gardening motivation, experience and comparison of different tasks. Moving heavy things in the garden is done by few of the older women and this task is more often done by their spouse/partner. It is also perceived as the least enjoyable and the most difficult gardening activity. Improving this task will empower older women to do this supporting task independently so that they do not rely on social networks or paid help. Tool aspects were found to be important for older women's gardening motivation, and improving on the task through product design is therefore expected to have a positive impact on gardening participation and consequently health and wellbeing of older women.",0,0,0,0
"The andragogical perspectives of older people's interaction with digital game technologies: Gameplay on gesture and touch-based platforms. Due to the engaging factor of gameplay afforded by digital game technologies, the application of games is becoming a popular medium in promoting and fostering serious outcomes in domains, such as education and health. For instance, social inclusion and healthy lifestyle can be motivated and stimulated through social interaction, cognitive exercises and physical activity afforded by digital game technology. Acknowledging the potential benefits of gameplay, this paper explores digital gaming from the perspectives of a specific target group - older people above the age of 55. It is essential that users or players are captivated and engaged by a game before any serious purposes/activities can be imposed. The design of most games used for both entertainment and serious purposes however focuses on the general player population, and mostly targeting a much younger population currently engaging with digital gaming. The paper thus aims to investigate the perspectives from this target group in terms of their direct interaction and experience with digital game technologies, specifically based on gesture and touch-based platforms. The paper will correlate the perspectives with the andragogical considerations, relevant challenges associated with older people, their existing/previous engagement with digital gaming and other interactive technologies. A pilot study was carried out with 14 participants, where data was collected from their interactions with and experiences of digital gaming. Questionnaires and group discussions were utilised in order to collect their feedback and perspectives on the experience. The results of our study show that there are three key findings which are; 1) the interaction types and the experience provided by the game itself, 2) the game interaction styles which is supported by the platforms and 3) gameplay interaction and challenges associated to agerelated changes. These findings should be considered when considering the interaction and experience of older people for digital game design. © The Authors, 2016. All Rights Reserved.",0,0,0,0
"+TV4E: Interactive Television as a Support to Push Information about Social Services to the Elderly. Ageing is a global phenomenon that in the last decades has led to a significant inversion of the ageing pyramid in the developed societies. This fact has been introducing deep changes in societies leading to increase attention towards seniors' concerns and needs and has leverage the appearance of multiple gerontechnologies. In this context television as an enabler technology is a promising option for the elderly, enabling to serve this population segment through features such as distance help, support of services that promote social interaction or provision of medical information. Despite the important investments that have been done by the State for the dissemination of such services, the existent technical solutions are mostly web-based, implying a ""pull-oriented"" activity rather than the ""push-oriented"" informative dynamic that most seniors are familiarized. In this paper we discuss the key set of features of an iTV application, aiming to enrich the television experience with interleaved informative content personalized to the user's profile. Also a special attention is given to the state of the art in the field of gerontechnologies enabled by interactive television systems in order to identify the gaps in features related with public and social services information spreading. © 2016 The Authors.",0,0,0,0
"An investigation of social inclusion through wearable technologies on technical self-efficacies of elderly. Mobile applications are prevalent in the society, consisting of population with different age groups, including a large proportion of elderly. Despite of the increasing number of elderly, we seldom take constraints of elderly into consideration when developing technologies, resulting in them being excluded in the society. In this study, we propose for wearable devices to be interfaced with gestures or eyetrackers. Wearable devices are anything that is worn. Thus, such interfaced wearable technology could be integrated into their daily activities so that they can be included into the society. To fill the gap of the need for interfaced wearable devices, this study draws upon expectancy-value theory to examine the significance of elderly's technical self-efficacy behind the adoption of wearable technologies. As an emergent research, we plan to evaluate the effects of elderly's technical self-efficacy empirically. This study will provide significant theoretical and practical contributions to existing knowledge about wearable technologies.",1,0,0,0
"Use of assistive technology and need for social support for elderly with physical disabilities. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine the use of assistive technology, social support in everyday life and psychological existential orientation for individuals with physical disabilities. Methods: Forty-six elderly persons with physical disabilities (aged 73.7±10.6 years, range 53-93 years) were examined with regard to the use of assistive technology, social support in everyday life and psychological existential orientation by an extensive questionnaire set (questionnaire for assistive technology (AT-24), questionnaire for social support (F-SOZU-K-22) and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Results: The subjects stated that they needed aid and social support in order to carry out their daily indoor/outdoor activities (for e.g. dressing, having a bath / shower, using toilet, eating, going up / down the stairs, shopping, or going out). The most commonly used mobility aid was the walking frame that accounted for 61.9%, followed by the walking stick with 40.5% and a bathtub lift with 21.4%. The results also showed the psychopathological symptoms in the sample. Discussion: Assistive technologies together with the support of relatives and care services help people to cope with a variety of activities in their daily lives with fewer restrictions. The effectiveness of the aids differs between participants because it depends on several factors such as health, knowledge, and information about aids, as well as the appropriate selection of aids.",1,0,0,1
"Autonomous systems to support social activity of elderly people: A prospective approach to a system design. The reduction in physical and social activity in elderly people degrades the aging process, causing or increasing suffering to the individual and to his family and friends. Most times, the individual well-being is related to the strength of the social bonds with the family and friends group, so it is important to keep this bonds in the various stages of life, especially in the later life, when the individual has health limitations and is living in a community centre. This paper proposes an exploratory approach, regarding the use of information technologies systems, as autonomous systems, to assist in supporting and encouraging elderly people to preserve and develop their social activities and the relationships with their family and friends social group. During the course of the aging process, some aging people have their social activity degraded due to health limitations and institutionalization in elderly care centers, in which they are admitted as residents. We propose the design of a software system, capable of running in autonomous devices, such as, robots and other consumer appliances, enabling them to recognize and interact with the users, according to their state of mind and the specific current moment context. The interactions should be simple and focused on keeping the users informed about the current life events of their family and friends, and create the opportunities for the users to interact with the participants of those events by creating interaction proposals. The systems would monitor the user's family and friends group, regarding their information and actions on the social media. The system's interactions with the user would be based on that knowledge and on the knowledge of the user's current context. An adaptive user interface would present and manage the user interactions, acting as a mediator between the user and his family and friends group. © 2016 IEEE.",0,0,0,0

Findings from this study demonstrates that use of digital gaming technologies promotes lifelong learning; optimization of mental, physical, and social stimulation; and independence, all of which promote the agenda of healthy aging. © The Author(s) 2015.",1,0,0,0
"An age simulated virtual environment for improving elderly wellbeing. Aging effects cause significant changes in the functionality and abilities of the elderly that affect the overall interaction of elder people with their environment and other people. However, since the aging process occurs gradually in a person’s life, it is not possible for humans who belong to younger generations to experience the effects of aging. Towards this end we propose the use of a Virtual Reality (VR) based application that allows users to experience the effects of aging before such changes affect their body and mind. The proposed application targets two main objectives: The first objective is to allow product and software designers to experience problems faced by the elderly so that they design products friendly to older people. The second objective is to increase the appreciation and social inclusion towards the elderly. The development of this application relies on an extensive study of the literature that describes biological changes due to aging, so that several age-related effects are simulated in a VR environment in order to allow users to virtually experience life as an older person. During an experimental evaluation users were requested to complete a simple task in the age simulated VR-environment using a VR headset, and the reactions of the users were registered using appropriate questionnaires. The results of a preliminary investigation show that users can have a better understanding and appreciation towards older people after they are exposed in a VR age simulated environment. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",0,0,0,0

Lack of information, makes people with disability not to consider themselves as part of spaces and to reject them, which results loss of contact with the inhabitants of the city. With a platform compatible with Android or iOS, mapping and diagnosing the accessibility conditions to tourist sights, historic buildings and cultural services, will be continuously updated with new information. Underlying this work is the expertise of the “Pro-access” Research Bureau (ABNT, NBR 9050 in Acessibilidade de Pessoas com Mobilidade Reduzida às Edificações, Espaços e Equipamentos Urbanos. Rio de Janeiro, 2015), which has developed methodologies for diagnosis accessibility, and is a national and world reference in the field. Our knowledge must be put to be used by society. Everyone have the right to access any place. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",0,0,0,0
"How can technology help intergenerational reminiscence? A pilot study. The goal of this study was to test the usability and efficacy of a website designed to support intergenerational reminiscence. The website allows older persons to capture, digitally archive, and share their memories encapsulated in letters, newspaper clippings, postcards, photos and videos. The evaluation involved 44 seniors and 176 children and consisted in two main phases. In the first phase, the usability of the website was assessed in a sample of elderly participants. In the second phase, the efficacy of online reminiscence was tested against a control condition, in which elderly people shared personal memories with children without the support of technology. Main dependent measures included self-esteem, loneliness and enjoyment/engagement with the activity (flow). Findings showed that the website was usable and well-accepted. However, the use of the platform did not significantly improve the effects of intergenerational reminiscence, which is an activity that participants enjoyed in itself.

"Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone. Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"The Roberta IRONSIDE project a cognitive and physical robot coach for dependent persons. Many elderly and dependent people living at home suffer from a lack of social contact. With their strength and physical condition decreasing, they are also reluctant to walk outside. Even in sheltered accommodation or hospitals, they may have phases of loneliness when they are left alone or when the personnel cannot continuously take care of them. With an aging population and the financial difficulties of having a full time caregiver for every dependent person living at home, the proliferation of advanced assistant robots seems to be a viable future solution. However, as most of what can be done with a robot is also possible without it, it is sometimes difficult to quantify the real value this technology can add to the current situation. Hence we believe that such a robot should be a reliable assistant, capable of helping a person indoors as well as outdoors. Furthermore, it should be a companion for dialoging, as well as a system capable of detecting health problems. The Roberta Ironside project proposes to build such an advanced robot. That is, we want to build a cognitive coach that on the one hand fulfills the lack of social contact, and on the other hand may transform into a physical coach when going outside. In this paper we propose an affordable and simplified design for this human-sized humanoid. It starts with an overall description of the robot, followed by a justification for the choice of putting it into an electric wheel-chair. Next, it emphasizes the technology that is used for the head and the face, and then ends with a discussion of the verbal and non-verbal communication capabilities of the robot, highlighting its distinct characteristics as an Embodied Conversational Agent. © 2016, AMSE Press.

"Assistive devices for human mobility and gait rehabilitation. Mobility is one of the most important human faculties and can be defined as the ability of an individual to move freely through multiple environments and perform daily personal tasks with ease (D.A. Winter, Biomechanics and Motor Control of Human Movement, Wiley, Hoboken, 2009, [1]). Neurological and age-related diseases affect human mobility at different levels causing partial or total loss of such faculty. In addition, mobility decreases gradually with age. Evidences show that mobility restrictions are also associated with cognitive and psychosocial disturbances, which further impairs the quality of life of the individual (A.S. Buchman et al., Cognitive function is associated with the development of mobility impairments in community-dwelling elders. Am. J. Geriatr. Psychiatr. 190(6):571-580, 2011, [2]). In this context, new technologies have emerged to improve the life conditions of people with motor impairments. Some remarks regarding the human locomotor system, mobility dysfunctions, assistive devices for enhancing mobility, functional compensation during walking and devices for gait rehabilitation will be presented in this chapter. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",0,0,0,0
"Cardioverter defibrillator implantation and immediate effects on patient lifestyle. Introduction: Implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICDs) recipients are considered high risk for sudden death. Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation history, ejection fraction <30% and coronary heart disease are some of the indications for their application. Other signs are the presence of arrhythmias due to right ventricular dysplasia, long QT syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Despite its life-saving potential, the holistic approach of ICD therapy carries a risk for physiological, psychological consequences and may affect the recipients lifestyle. Aim: The aim of this study was the investigation of patients' comparative assessment the general health, physiological and psychological state and the quality of life after the recent implanted defibrillator. Methods: The study population consisted of 65 patients (44 men and 21 women) who were recent recipients of implantable cardioverter defibrillator. There was no shockable patient. Data were collected through a telephone interview with the patients, using a questionnaire which included social and demographic characteristics and the rest were based from SF-36, DURU QUESTIONNAIRE and General Health and self-esteem questionnaires. Results: The reliability of the questionnaire was very good based on the internal consistency Cronbach index (a=0.732). The parameters of physiological and psychological status, general health and overall the quality of life of people after recent defibrillator implantation showed no significant measurable differences. However, the socio-demographic parameters, gender (female vs male), age (<vs> 50 years), educational level (> vs <graduates High School, colleges & universities) and workers differentiate significantly the parameters of self-esteem, quality of life, general health, daily physical and social activities. Most vulnerable in this study are women, elder patients, workers. Moreover, it was found a positive correlation between patients' educational level and daily roles limitation (p=0,002). There were no more statistically important correlations between marital status and quality of life in both the physical health axis (physical functioning, role fulfillment limitation, pain/body image, general health) and mental health axis (emotional well-being, social functioning, view of life with the ICD). Conclusions: The technology progress of ICDs with the improvement of the implantation procedure minimized the negative influence they use to have in recipients' quality of life. But, there are some demographic characteristics which continue to be independent risk factors for worse quality of life after implantation. More researches should take place in order to be found better approaches of ICD recipients for improvement of their physical and psychosocial well-being.",0,0,0,1
"Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare. Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",1,0,0,1
"Promoting active aging with a paper-based SNS application. Social Networking Sites have become useful tools to strengthen communication with family and friends. Older adults, however, are often hesitant to use SNSs and are reluctant adopters of modern communication media. This results in an asymmetric condition, where younger and older adults use different media and communication channels. To balance communication practices we integrated classic media based on pen and paper with online social networks. In this paper we present a 36 weeks deployment study with an extended family (n=12) of the use of Tlatosketch, a hybrid system based on a digital photo frame, and digital pen and paper technology. This combination allows older adults to stay updated on Facebook and to post paper notes to Facebook. Our results show that Tlatosketch provides the older adult with a new media for self-expression, and improves the family social experience, thus helping them remain active while ageing. We close discussing directions for future work. © 2015 ICST.",1,1,1,0
"Older adults' use of a novel communication system: Client goals versus participant experiences. This paper reports on the outcomes of a collaborative industry project which designed and deployed a novel communication systems for older adults. We outline a gap between the goals of our industry partner and the needs and experiences of our participants. We highlight the need to carefully consider the location of set-up, the training needs of older people, and any existing social support networks and technological systems already in use, while ultimately recognising the emotional connections of older people. These contextual factors influence individual older adults' acceptance, use and adoption of novel technologies such as the one presented in this paper. Copyright © 2015 ACM.",1,0,0,0
Improving interactive health literacy skills of older adults: Lessons learned from formative organizational research with community partners. Background: Meals on Wheels (MOW) organizations are ideal community partners for delivering social support relating to health information exchange for vulnerable and home-bound older adults. Objectives: This article illustrates how formative organizational evaluation can be used to adapt health literacy interventions delivered by community partners. Methods: Key informant interviews and ethnographic observations were conducted as part of a formative organizational evaluation of potential community partners. Lessons Learned: The observed brevity of volunteer-client interaction led program planners to incorporate substantial emphasis on communicating with older adults into the health literacy coach training curriculum. Ethnographic observations made clear that program materials had to be portable and fit it in with the mobile nature of MOW delivery. Conclusions: Formative organizational research can greatly increase the chance of successful implementation of public health interventions when those interventions will be implemented in partnerships with community-based organizations in diverse settings and with varying practices. © 2015 The Johns Hopkins University Press.,0,0,0,1
"Depression in elderly people living in rural Nigeria and its association with perceived health, poverty, and social network. Background: The relationship between late-life depression, poverty, social network, and perceived health is little studied in Africa; the magnitude of the problem remains largely unknown and there is an urgent need to research into this area. Methods: We interviewed community dwelling elderly persons of two rural areas in Nigeria using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30). Those who scored 11 and above on the GDS-30 were further interviewed using Geriatric Mental State Schedule (GMSS). Diagnosis of depression was based on the International Classification of Diseases 10th edition (ICD-10) and GMSS-Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy (GMMS-AGECAT). Results: A total of 458 community dwelling elderly persons participated in the study of which 57% were females. Mean age of the participants was 73.65(±7.8) years (95% CI 72.93-74.37). The mean GDS-30 and MMSE scores were 4.15(±4.80) and 21.73(±4.67), respectively. A total of 59 and 58 participants had depression based on ICD-10 criteria and GMSS-AGECAT, respectively. Agreement between ICD-10 and AGECAT diagnoses was κ = 0.931. By multiple logistic regression analysis, late-life depression was significantly associated with financial difficulties (Odds ratio 4.52 and bereavement Odds ratio 2.70). Conclusion: Late-life depression in this cohort is associated with health and socio-economic factors that are worth paying attention to, in a region of economic deprivation and inadequate healthcare. © International Psychogeriatric Association 2015.",1,0,0,1
"The effects of playing Nintendo Wii on depression, sense of belonging and social support in Australian aged care residents: a protocol study of a mixed methods intervention trial. Background: The proportion of people aged 65 or older is the fastest growing age group worldwide. Older adults in aged care facilities have higher levels of depression, and lower levels of social support and sense of belonging compared with older adults living in the community. Research has begun to assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve the mental health of residents and has found both cognitive and physical benefits of video game playing. The benefits of playing these games in a group may also lead to greater social interaction and decreased loneliness. The current study aims to investigate an intervention program designed to foster relationships among older adults in care based on shared interests. Residents will be assessed on the effectiveness of a 6 week program of playing Wii bowling in comparison to a control group. Method/Design: Participants will be allocated to the intervention (Wii bowling) or the control group based on their place of residence. Participants in the intervention group will be invited to participate in Wii bowling twice weekly, with up to three other residents for a period of 6 weeks. Residents in both conditions will be assessed for depression, social support, sense of belonging, and current self-rated mood at pre-intervention (0 weeks), post-intervention (6 weeks), and at 2-month follow up (14 weeks). Qualitative data on social interaction between group members will also be collected at weeks 1, 3, and 6. Both groups will receive a Wii console after week 6 to establish if residents and staff engage with the Wii without intervention. Discussion: The Wii provides a user friendly platform for older adults to use video games, and it incorporates both social and competitive aspects in the game play. Existing research has not extensively investigated the social aspects of using this type of technology with older adults. If found to be effective, incorporating Wii games into an activity schedule may benefit the mental health of older adults living in care by establishing an intervention that is fun, economical, and easy to use.

"Privacy trust crisis of personal data in China in the era of Big Data: The survey and countermeasures. Privacy trust directly affects the personal willingness to share data and thus influences the quality and size of the data, thus affecting the development of big data technology and industry. As China is probably the largest personal data pool and vastest application market of big data, the situation of Chinese privacy trust plays a significant role. Based on the 17 most common data collection scenarios, the following aspects have been observed through 508 questionnaires and interviews of 20 samples.To start with, there is a severe privacy trust crisis in China, both in the field of enterprise services such as online shopping and social networks, etc. and in some public services like medical care and education, etc. Besides, there are also doubts about data collected by the government since individuals refuse to offer personal information or give false information as much as possible. Some people even buy two phone numbers, one is in use, while the other is not carried around or used by them, which is only bought to be offered to data collectors. Secondly, in terms of gender, females have lower trust in enterprises and social associations than males, especially in the fields of social networks and personal consumption. However, there is no obvious difference in fields of government and public services. Females possess stronger awareness but less skilled in precautions than males. Thirdly, people between the ages of 18 and 50 are more suspicious of data collected by enterprises, while age exerts little obvious influence on the credibility of data collected by the government, social associations and public services. Older people are less aware of precautions than people at other ages. In addition, from the perspective of education background, people with higher degrees possess stronger awareness of precautions and thus lower degree of trust. Therefore, it is suggested that more education on privacy consciousness should be given, and relative laws as well as regulations need improving. Besides, innovation in privacy protection technologies should be encouraged. What is more, we need to reinforce the management of the internet industry and strictly regulate personal data collection of the government. © 2015 Zhong Wang & Qian Yu.",0,0,0,0
"Transition of long-term care in Hungary: Problems and solutions. The study presents the challenges of long-term care for the elderly from 1993 to the present, which arise from the poor state of health of the population over 65. It analyses the related trend in policy on the elderly, how a positive trend up to 2008 took a negative turn. Against this background, it examines the role family carers play in caregiving. Their task has become increasingly difficult as a result of the state shifting responsibility to the families, strong demographic ageing and the appearance of declining health in an early stage of the life cycle. Alternative solutions must be found to relieve this burden, and one possible direction is the incorporation of ICT into long-term care.

"New technology and illness self-management: Potential relevance for resource-poor populations in Asia. Advances in technology have made it possible for many standard diagnostic and health monitoring procedures, traditionally carried out by qualified personnel within medical facilities, to be reliably undertaken by patients or carers in their own homes with a minimum of basic training. There has also been a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of both sources of information on health issues and the possibilities for sharing information and experiences over ICT-based social networks. It has been suggested that these developments have the potential to 'empower' patients, reducing their dependence on providers and possibly improving their quality of care by increasing the volume and timeliness of diagnostic data and encouraging active self-management of their condition, for example through lifestyle changes. Perhaps more significantly, it is also seen by many economies with ageing populations as a way to contain high and ever rising healthcare costs.It has also been suggested that a move to greater self-management supported by expert networks and smart phone technology could improve the treatment of many millions of patients with chronic diseases in low and middle income economies that are also confronting the potential cost implications of epidemiological and demographic transitions, combined with the higher expectations of a more educated and knowledgeable population. There is now limited evidence that some fairly basic e- and mHealth interventions, for example in the areas of MNCH, malaria and HIV/AIDS can have a positive impact, even in resource-poor contexts. The aim here is to explore the extent to which further investment in technology could play a role in the development of an effective and affordable health sector strategy for at least some developing economies. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the approach may be highly dependent on the specific health conditions addressed, the nature of existing health systems and the overall socio-economic and cultural context. © 2014 The Author.",0,0,0,0
"Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial. Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

"The Women Independently Living Alone with a Medical Alert Device (WILMA) trial. Women are more likely to live alone compared with men, and therefore have more difficulty activating emergency medical systems for stroke. The goal of this study was to examine the benefit of wearing medical alert devices to activate emergency medical systems for elderly women living alone. This was a randomized, controlled pilot trial. Women over 60 with at least 1 stroke risk factor were recruited from Southeast Michigan. Subjects received either a medical alert device or control. The primary outcome was change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) from baseline to 90 days of wearing the device or control. A planned sample size of 320 could not be reached, and the trial was stopped at 265 women randomized prior to data examination. On average, the treatment group was older, reported lower prevalence of high cholesterol, and was less likely to complete follow-up. There was a nonsignificant smaller loss of healthy days in the past month in the intervention group (0.46) compared with the control group (2.23) (p = 0.213). Similarly, the secondary outcomes of changes in anxiety, depression, and changes in perceived isolation did not differ by treatment and control groups. This study did not establish improvement in HRQOL among women who wore the device compared with those that did not, nor the feasibility of a trial to study the efficacy of medical alert devices in elderly women. Newer devices that use cellular technology may be more accepted than the landline-based system used in this study. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",1,1,1,0

"The effects of simulated vision impairments on the cone of gaze. Detecting the gaze direction of others is critical for many social interactions. We explored factors that may make the perception of mutual gaze more difficult, including the degradation of the stimulus and simulated vision impairment. To what extent do these factors affect the complex assessment of mutual gaze? Using an interactive virtual head whose eye direction could be manipulated by the subject, we conducted two experiments to assess the effects of simulated vision impairments on mutual gaze. Healthy subjects had to demarcate the center and the edges of the cone of gaze—that is, the range of gaze directions that are accepted for mutual gaze. When vision was impaired by adding a semitransparent white contrast reduction mask to the display (Exp. 1), judgments became more variable and more influenced by the head direction (indicative of a compensation strategy). When refractive blur was added (Exp. 1), the gaze cone shrank from 12.9° (no blur) to 11.3° (3-diopter lens), which cannot be explained by a low-level process but might reflect a tightening of the criterion for mutual gaze as a response to the increased uncertainty. However, the overall effects of the impairments were relatively modest. Elderly subjects (Exp. 2) produced more variability but did not differ qualitatively from the younger subjects. In the face of artificial vision impairments, compensation mechanisms and criterion changes allow us to perform better in mutual gaze perception than would be predicted by a simple extrapolation from the losses in basic visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. © 2015, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",0,0,0,0
"Agent-based model forecasts aging of the population of people who inject drugs in metropolitan chicago and changing prevalence of Hepatitis C infections. People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk for blood-borne pathogens transmitted during the sharing of contaminated injection equipment, particularly hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV prevalence is influenced by a complex interplay of drug-use behaviors, social networks, and geography, as well as the availability of interventions, such as needle exchange programs. To adequately address this complexity in HCV epidemic forecasting, we have developed a computational model, the Agent-based Pathogen Kinetics model (APK). APK simulates the PWID population in metropolitan Chicago, including the social interactions that result in HCV infection. We used multiple empirical data sources on Chicago PWID to build a spatial distribution of an in silico PWID population and modeled networks among the PWID by considering the geography of the city and its suburbs. APK was validated against 2012 empirical data (the latest available) and shown to agree with network and epidemiological surveys to within 1%. For the period 2010-2020, APK forecasts a decline in HCV prevalence of 0.8% per year from 44(±2)% to 36(±5)%, although some sub-populations would continue to have relatively high prevalence, including Non-Hispanic Blacks, 48(±5)%. The rate of decline will be lowest in Non-Hispanic Whites and we find, in a reversal of historical trends, that incidence among non-Hispanic Whites would exceed incidence among Non-Hispanic Blacks (0.66 per 100 per years vs 0.17 per 100 person years). APK also forecasts an increase in PWID mean age from 35(±1) to 40(±2) with a corresponding increase from 59 (±2)% to 80(±6)% in the proportion of the population >30 years old. Our studies highlight the importance of analyzing subpopulations in disease predictions, the utility of computer simulation for analyzing demographic and health trends among PWID and serve as a tool for guiding intervention and prevention strategies in Chicago, and other major cities.",0,0,0,0
"Back to the future – Feasibility of recruitment and retention to patient education and telephone follow-up after hip fracture: A pilot randomized controlled trial. Objectives: Our primary aim of this pilot study was to test feasibility of the planned design, the interventions (education plus telephone coaching), and the outcome measures, and to facilitate a power calculation for a future randomized controlled trial to improve adherence to recovery goals following hip fracture. Design: This is a parallel 1:1 randomized controlled feasibility study. Setting: The study was conducted in a teaching hospital in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Participants: Participants were community-dwelling adults over 60 years of age with a recent hip fracture. They were recruited and assessed in hospital, and then randomized after hospital discharge to the intervention or control group by a web-based randomization service. Treatment allocation was concealed to the investigators, measurement team, and data entry assistants and analysts. Participants and the research physiotherapist were aware of treatment allocation. Intervention: Intervention included usual care for hip fracture plus a 1-hour in-hospital educational session using a patient-centered educational manual and four videos, and up to five postdischarge telephone calls from a physiotherapist to provide recovery coaching. The control group received usual care plus a 1-hour in-hospital educational session using the educational manual and videos. Measurement: Our primary outcome was feasibility, specifically recruitment and retention of participants. We also collected selected health outcomes, including health-related quality of life (EQ5D-5L), gait speed, and psychosocial factors (ICEpop CAPability measure for Older people and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Results: Our pilot study results indicate that it is feasible to recruit, retain, and provide follow-up telephone coaching to older adults after hip fracture. We enrolled 30 older adults (mean age 81.5 years; range 61–97 years), representing a 42% recruitment rate. Participants excluded were those who were not community dwelling on admission, were discharged to a residential care facility, had physician-diagnosed dementia, and/or had medical contraindications to participation. There were 27 participants who completed the study: eleven in the intervention group, 15 in the control group, and one participant completed a qualitative interview only. There were no differences between groups for health measures. Conclusion: We highlight the feasibility of telephone coaching for older adults after hip fracture to improve adherence to mobility recovery goals. © 2015 Langford et al.",1,1,1,1
"Development and feasibility of an automated call monitoring intervention for older wheelchair users: The MOvIT project. Background: Recent advances in wheeled mobility technology are multiplying opportunities for community integration and improved quality of life. The mobility needs of older wheelchair users are particularly complex due to a constellation of chronic conditions and comorbidities that may compromise optimal use of the device. The purpose of the Mobility Outcomes via Information Technologies (MOvIT) project is to examine the feasibility of automated calls for the systematic monitoring for adverse outcomes associated with wheelchair use. Methods: A two-phase mixed methods approach was used. Phase I involved user-centered development and face validation of a monitoring questionnaire with end-users (seven wheelchair users and five healthcare providers). Phase II tested the feasibility of monitoring outcomes using automated calls to administer the MOvIT questionnaire 1 and 3 months after wheelchair delivery with a prospective cohort of older adults (50-84 years of age). When problems were identified, the computer monitoring system notified a clinical coordinator who followed up with respondents requiring interventions. Feasibility data were extracted from the web database and from individual interviews covering perceived ease of use, usefulness and intention to use the MOvIT questionnaire in the future. Results: The MOvIT monitoring questionnaire developed in phase I tracks nine potential wheelchair-related adverse outcomes considered important for end-users: 1) non-use of wheelchair, 2) pain, 3) skin condition, 4) positioning, 5) wheelchair incidents, 6) psychosocial issues, 7) restricted wheelchair participation, 8) limited wheelchair skills and knowledge, and 9) technical problems. In phase II, 92 individuals who received a wheelchair were eligible, 71 out of 92 accepted (77 %) and 65 out of 71 (92 %) completed the 3-month follow-up. In the sample of 65 participants, a wheelchair-related adverse outcome was confirmed by a rehabilitation professional for 58.5 %, and at least one recommendation was given to 66.2 % during the 3-month monitoring period. A majority of participants found the intervention useful (82.8 %) and said they intended to use the MOvIT monitoring questionnaire in the future (81.5 %). Participants made suggestions to make the calls more adaptive to various ability profiles. Conclusions: Automated calls tailored for individuals with mobility limitations and associated comorbidities are a promising approach to reach clients who need post-rehabilitation support. © 2015 Auger et al.",0,0,0,1
"ICT-enabled communication tools for the elderly: A proximity-based social communication tool. Elderly population is growing all over the globe. Social life (social contact, social support, social participation) and communication are important factors for ageing well. Research has shown the potential benefit of ICT-enabled communication tools and social networks for the elderly. The number of elderly people appearing on social networks is increasing. However, not all the available tools are effective for the elderly users. In this chapter, authors propose a communication model for the elderly. Focusing mainly on the locality of the users, a social communication tool for the elderly is proposed which is built around six main features: proximity, proactivity, less content more contact, visual map-based interface, gamification of support, and personal assistant. © 2016, IGI Global.

"Does the Internet matter for strong ties? Bonding social capital, Internet use, and age-based inequality. As the Internet becomes pervasive in western societies, social capital emerges as a valuable sociological tool to analyze the social effects of Internet use. Thus, a growing body of research has been looking into the relationship between social capital and Internet usage. This research has been showing a positive relationship between them; however, results are not as conclusive when we consider one of the main dimensions of social capital: bonding. Bonding relates to resources that are embedded in one’s strong ties (i.e., family members and close friends). The study of bonding is of particular sociological interest, since the discussion around the social effects of the Internet still suggests that it takes time away from strong ties and that is more useful to connect with weak ties (i.e., acquaintances). This study examines the relationship between bonding and the Internet, using representative survey data and semi-structured interviews from Portugal. Findings show that bonding is predicted positively by Internet use but negatively by age. On one hand, the Internet seems to compensate for the negative age effect because older adults who use it are more likely to have a high level of bonding. On the other hand, the Internet reinforces accumulated social advantage. Â© 2015 University of Rome ‘La Sapienza’.",0,0,0,0
"Striking a balance between in-person care and the use of eHealth to support the older rural population with chronic pain. New and existing information communication technologies (ICT) are playing an increasingly important role in the delivery of health and social care services. eHealth1 has the potential to supplement in-person home visits for older, rural adults with chronic pain. The Technology to support Older Adults' Personal and Social Interaction project-TOPS-examines interactions between older people and their health/social care providers and considers how eHealth could play a part in enhancing the life experiences of older people with chronic pain, who live in remote/rural areas. This paper reports findings from the TOPS study, drawing upon observations of health/social care home visits to chronic pain patients and interviews with patients and health/social care providers in rural Scotland. Patients and care professionals believe in-person care promotes the general well-being of older people with pain. However, our findings show that the potential recipients of eHealth are open to the use of such technologies and that although they cannot be expected to replace existing models of care, eHealth may provide opportunities to sustain and enhance these interactions. © 2015 A.

"Job strain and coping among ageing baby boomers [Berufliche Belastungen und Coping in der Babyboomer-Generation]. Background: Research indicates that the so-called baby boomer generation (the population born after World War II) exhibits worrying health trends. Taking age-cohort effects into account, it is still unclear how the mechanisms concerning stress and health function and how the distribution of stressors, stress mediators and stress effects on health differ between generations. Objectives: The article approaches stress from a generational perspective asking: which are the stressors the baby boomer generation is facing? Under which conditions and with which resources is exposure to stressors harmful to health? Is there an accumulation of stress in later working life? Material and methods: In the course of the project “Wellbeing”, a quantitative online survey was carried out in selected commercial enterprises and public institutions in four project partner countries. The results for Austrian participants are presented in this article. Results: Employees of the baby boomer generation are exposed to both time-related and social stressors at the workplace and a high percentage of respondents expressed symptoms of physical and psychological stress. Stress mediators, such as agency-based coping strategies and social resources at the workplace could buffer these stressors; however, stressors and stress mediators are significantly correlated creating a “triple whammy” effect (i.e. exposure to stressors, lack of social resources and restricted coping), which particularly affects older male baby boomers. Conclusion: Social support buffers the negative effects of a limited health and lower education for female baby boomers, which supports the buffering hypothesis of social convoy theory, whereas male baby boomers lack the resources to effectively cope with work stress. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",1,0,0,1
"Understanding Facebook use and the psychological affects of use across generations. Abstract Background Although the popularity of social networking sites (SNS), such as Facebook, continues to increase, little research has centered on users outside of undergraduate institutions. There is evidence to suggest age impacts overall SNS use, but little is known about how different age groups use Facebook, and whether use is associated with improved or diminished well-being. Method This study examined how individuals aged 18-70+ years used Facebook, and how their well-being was impacted by said use. An anonymous survey was completed by 529 individuals assessing the association between age, frequency of Facebook use in the past 30 days, trouble controlling use, body-image as it pertained to use, and site-related social fulfillment. A series of univariate ANOVAs and regressions were conducted to better understand differences in use and effects of use on trichotomized age groups. Results Results indicate that there are significant differences in both the ways in which older adults use Facebook and the effects Facebook has on this population compared to younger cohorts. Findings suggest that younger adults use Facebook more frequently and are significantly more emotionally impacted by the site than older adults. For example, younger adults spend more time per day on the site and experience more negative body image because of Facebook than do older adults. These preliminary findings highlight the need for more research into the effects of SNS on individuals of different age groups and individualized intervention methods for SNS-related problems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Culture effects in online social support for older people: perceptions and experience. Technology in general and online support communities in particular can play a key role in the lives of older adults. However, these environments are not always well understood or are often misused. This paper reports an investigation of older adults’ perceptions and experiences of online social support and Web use in Cyprus. A discussion of the results from a similar study in UK reveals interesting differences on the various levels of uncertainty avoidance and collectivism in the two countries. The described research has a culture-driven design approach and aims to collect users’ perceptions of online social support and Web use. Qualitative analysis of interviews of three groups of older Cypriot users with different expertise in Web usage was employed. The findings of this study were compared to a similar study conducted with older adults in UK. The significance of this study lies in understanding better the role of beliefs embodied in a country’s culture and affects older adults’ perceptions of online social support and compares them with another culture. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",1,0,0,0
"The impacts of social interactions in MMORPGs on older adults' social capital. Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) can offer older adults many opportunities to maintain current and develop meaningful and supportive relationships. Social capital plays an important role in later life. This study analyzed the relationships between older adults' social interactions in MMORPGs and their online social capital. A Web questionnaire was published to eight World of Warcraft (WoW, a popular MMORPG) player forums. A total of 222 older adults who were aged 55+ and mainly living in North America completed the questionnaire and became the participants of this study. To answer the research questions and test the four hypotheses, hierarchical multiple regression analysis was applied, and Cohen's f2 was computed to compare effect sizes. It is found that enjoyment of relationships has deep impacts on older adults' social capital. The positive effects of gameplay on older adults are much dependent on the context of gameplay and enjoyment of relationships. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0,0,0,0
"To a Deeper Understanding of Loneliness amongst Older Irish Adults. Loneliness can play a significant role in the wellbeing of older adults. This article describes a qualitative method for using case notes from the clinical records of older individuals in order to investigate the priority concerns spontaneously reported by older adults to deepen our understanding of both the context in which reported loneliness occurs in Ireland and the potential triggers. The participants in this study represent a cross-section of older adults who participated in the Technology Research for Independent Living Clinic (TRIL). Data were collected from participants through interviewer case notes at the TRIL centre in St James's hospital, Dublin. 624 participants (431 females; 193 males) ranging in age from 60-92 years (Mean 73 years, SD 7 years) took part in the study. All were community dwelling and provided consent. A thematic analysis from grounded theory was used to evaluate the case notes for each participant. Preliminary results highlight the richness of phenomenological experience to enhance our understanding of loneliness and provide an opportunity to better understand the precursors and variability that loneliness may take. In this study we found themes in the case note analysis linking social loneliness with self-imposed limitations on social engagement due to declining health while predominate themes for emotionally lonely focused on psychological issues of stress and anxiety associated with adverse life events. The results suggest the importance of case notes to inform clinical practice. Qualitative results provided insights into differing live events of older Irish adults, which help distinguish the causal differences between social and emotional loneliness.",1,0,0,0
"Casual gaming to encourage active ageing. Natural interfaces are facilitating the adoption of videogames by older adults, promoting the development of serious games aimed at encouraging healthy behaviors in this population. In this paper we present the design and evaluation of an ambient game, GuessMyCaption, aimed at enhancing the social networks of older adults, known to have an impact in their wellbeing. GuessMyCaption was deployed during a 5-weeks study in the home of one older adult and twelve relatives. The results demonstrate that GuessMyCaption is easy to use and maintains an older adult engaged with exercises while offering new opportunities for online and offline socialization. GuessMyCaption had a positive impact in the perceived wellbeing of the older adult improving her perception on her cognitive skills and physical health, and catalyzing socialization. This research shows that the use of natural interfaces and family memorabilia facilitate the adoption of serious games, improves older adults' perceived wellbeing, and encourage socialization. © 2015 IEEE.",1,1,1,0
"Co-constructing community: A conceptual map for reuniting aging people in prison with their families and communities. This two-phase qualitative study explores key stakeholder perspectives on the historical roles of family and community that shape the current reunification experiences of older adults released from prison. In phase one, 16 service providers from 16 community reentry programs responded to an online survey that included open-ended questions about what factors influenced the community reunification of older adults. In phase two, 31 formerly incarcerated older men and women participated in one 90-min in-depth semistructured interview. The qualitative data were analyzed using constant comparative methods. The participants shared their personal experiences about the factors that influenced their life before, during, and after their most recent incarceration. Both staff and formerly incarcerated adults most commonly reported structural barriers, such as employment and housing (i.e., homelessness) that posed a challenge to successful reunification. They also reported personal and social barriers that included a history of substance abuse and lack of family and other social supports. These findings suggest that the quality of informal and formal caregiving before, during, and after prison had a powerful influence on formerly incarcerated elders’ notions of family and community and how they navigated their most recent community reunification experience. A conceptual model for reuniting returning senior citizens from prison with their families and communities and promotes health equity and justice is presented to guide prevention, assessment, and intervention. © 2015 American Psychological Association.",1,0,0,0
"Deriving requirements for social media based community policing: Insights from police. Community policing helps curb high crime rate and overcome limited police resources. The success of community policing depends on active citizen participation. Previous research shows Online Social Networks (OSN) such as Facebook encourage active citizen participation during law and order situations. However, little is known about role of OSN in developing community relations between police and citizens. Developing countries such as India have limited police personnel which increases the need of community policing. This project explores perceptions of senior police officers on the role of OSN and develops a set of requirements for an OSN based system that can enhance citizens' interaction with police. From the interview of twenty officers of Indian Police Services (IPS), we show four broad aspects in which OSN helps community policing: (1) strengthen social ties, (2) enforce social norms, (3) enable citizen reporting, and (4) keep citizens informed.",0,0,0,0
"Co-production in practice: How people with assisted living needs can help design and evolve technologies and services. Background: The low uptake of telecare and telehealth services by older people may be explained by the limited involvement of users in the design. If the ambition of 'care closer to home' is to be realised, then industry, health and social care providers must evolve ways to work with older people to co-produce useful and useable solutions. Method: We conducted 10 co-design workshops with users of telehealth and telecare, their carers, service providers and technology suppliers. Using vignettes developed from in-depth ethnographic case studies, we explored participants' perspectives on the design features of technologies and services to enable and facilitate the co-production of new care solutions. Workshop discussions were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Results: Analysis revealed four main themes. First, there is a need to raise awareness and provide information to potential users of assisted living technologies (ALTs). Second, technologies must be highly customisable and adaptable to accommodate the multiple and changing needs of different users. Third, the service must align closely with the individual's wider social support network. Finally, the service must support a high degree of information sharing and coordination. Conclusions: The case vignettes within inclusive and democratic co-design workshops provided a powerful means for ALT users and their carers to contribute, along with other stakeholders, to technology and service design. The workshops identified a need to focus attention on supporting the social processes that facilitate the collective efforts of formal and informal care networks in ALT delivery and use. © 2015 Wherton et al.",0,0,0,1
"A longitudinal study of midage women with indicators of disordered eating. This longitudinal study of midage women has two main aims: to examine the effect of disordered eating (DE) on quality of life (QoL) among women, including a comparison with a younger cohort and to investigate the mediating roles of both depressive symptoms and social support on the longitudinal relationship between DE and QoL as potential mechanisms of action. We used self-report data from six waves of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health over 14 years. A total of 12,338 women participating in the midage cohort (aging from 45-50 to 59-64) provided self-report indications of DE at Surveys 1 and 2, and QoL (SF-36 component scales-mental [MCS] and physical [PCS]) at Surveys 2-6. DE was reported by 10.98% of the women; this group also reported significantly poorer mental and physical QoL than those without DE, and this effect was sustained over time. Comparison with a parallel analysis of a younger cohort of women showed that the effect on midage women's physical QoL is greater than that of the younger women. The relationships between baseline DE and changes in QoL (both physical and mental) over time were mediated by levels of depressive symptoms and of social support over time. This study underscores the significant effect of DE on QoL in midage, an effect which is partially or fully mediated by depressive symptoms or social support. Well-being of midage women with indicators of DE needs to be supported by tailoring prevention and interventions activities specifically for this group. © 2015 American Psychological Association.",0,0,0,0
"The effect of an information and communication technology (ICT) on older adults' quality of life: Study protocol for a randomized control trial. Background: This study investigates the use of an information and communication technology (Elder Tree) designed for older adults and their informal caregivers to improve older adult quality of life and address challenges older adults face in maintaining their independence (for example, loneliness and isolation, falling, managing medications, driving and transportation). Methods/Design: This study, an unblinded randomized controlled trial, will evaluate the effectiveness and cost of Elder Tree. Older adults who are at risk for losing their independence - along with their informal caregivers, if they name them - are randomized to two groups. The intervention group has access to their usual sources of information and communication as well as to Elder Tree for 18 months while the control group uses only their usual sources of information and communication. The primary outcome of the study is older adult quality of life. Secondary outcomes are cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year and the impact of the technology on independence, loneliness, falls, medication management, driving and transportation, and caregiver appraisal and mastery. We will also examine the mediating effect of self-determination theory. We will evaluate the effectiveness of Elder Tree by comparing intervention- and control-group participants at baseline and months 6, 12, and 18. We will use mixed-effect models to evaluate the primary and secondary outcomes, where pretest score functions as a covariate, treatment condition is a between-subjects factor, and the multivariate outcome reflects scores for a given assessment at the three time points. Separate analyses will be conducted for each outcome. Cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year will be compared between the intervention and control groups. Additional analyses will examine the mediating effect of self-determination theory on each outcome. Discussion: Elder Tree is a multifaceted intervention, making it a challenge to assess which services or combinations of services account for outcomes in which subsets of older adults. If Elder Tree can improve quality of life and reduce healthcare costs among older adults, it could suggest a promising way to ease the burden that advancing age can place on older adults, their families, and the healthcare system. © Gustafson et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",0,0,0,1
"My hand doesn't listen to me! : Adoption and evaluation of a communication technology for the 'oldest old'. Adoption and use of novel technology by the institutionalized 'oldest old' (80+) is understudied. This population is the fastest growing demographic group in developed countries, providing design opportunities and challenges for HCI. Since the recruitment of oldest old people is challenging, research tends to focus on older adults (65+) and their use of and attitudes towards existing communication technologies, or on their caregivers and social ties. Our study deployed a novel communication appliance among five frail oldest old people living in a long-term care facility, which included field observations and usability and accessibility tests. Our findings suggest factors that facilitate and hinder the adoption of communication technologies, such as social, attitudinal, digital literacy, physical, and usability. We also discuss issues that arise in studying technology adoption by the oldest old, including usability and accessibility testing, and suggest solutions that may be helpful to HCI researchers working with this population. © Copyright 2015 ACM.",1,0,0,0
"Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare Organization, structure and delivery of healthcare. Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",1,0,0,1
"Age Differences in Online Social Networking: Extending Socioemotional Selectivity Theory to Social Network Sites. This article extends socioemotional selectivity theory to online social networking by examining age differences in the size and composition of Facebook networks across a wide age range of Facebook users (18 to 93 years old) in a nationally representative sample. Findings suggest increasing selectivity of Facebook social partners with age. Compared to younger adults, friend networks of older adults are smaller but contain a greater proportion of individuals who are considered to be actual friends. Moreover, a higher proportion of actual to total Facebook friends is associated with lower levels of social isolation and loneliness across the life span. © , Copyright Taylor & Francis.",0,0,0,0
"Past experiences, current practices and future design. Ethnographic study of aging adults' everyday ICT practices - And how it could benefit public ubiquitous computing design.. This article discusses how the elderly experience their ICT usage as the aging citizens of the Finnish information society. Through reflexive ethnographic analysis the human-(non-)human boundary-making and temporalities are analyzed from the ""ICT biographies"" of sixteen interviewees. The perspectives of aging as lived experience and as socio-cultural phenomenon; and the socio-materiality entangled with temporal layers; are combined to understand the intra-action between the aging ICT users and technology. The social relations are discussed as an essential part of this intra-action: the interviewees perceive themselves as slow and clumsy ICT users in relation to younger ""generations"", for example. In the boundary making between humans and machines, the interviewees' previous experiences on communication technologies are significant. Continuing on the path set by previous studies on ICT and aging, this article further discusses the benefits of ethnographic study on existing ICT practices for computing design. What could be learnt from these practices in relation to, for example, technology usage in private and public places, negative and positive experiences, motivations and needs of aging citizens? How could design benefit from understanding aging as situated, lived experience; and on the other hand, from investigating research process through reflexive ethnography? © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",1,0,0,0
"Enabling accessibility features in enhanced VR environments for supporting spatial abilities and social interaction in elderly and MCI patients. This chapter addresses the critical issue of usability evaluation of interfaces by elderly users and the accessibility limitations concerning the infotainment domain of virtual spaces. The main idea behind this research is to achieve a shift in more adaptive HCI used in infotainment applications and in particular in socially aware 3D Virtual Environments (Metaverses) like Second Life. Among the main goals of the present work is to examine the ability of older persons and users with Mild Cognitive Impairments (MCI) that are familiarized with computers and VR environments, to access and navigate effectively through realistic scenarios based on daily simple activities. Findings propose better design practices for industrial HCI engineers to enhance the quality of interaction with Metaverses by customizing both the immersive and 2D interfaces to the needs and preferences of the special user groups mentioned before. © 2015, IGI Global.

"Effect of a multifaceted educational program for care staff concerning fecal incontinence in nursing home patients: Study protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial. Background: Fecal incontinence has a high prevalence in the older population, which cannot be explained by comorbidity or the anatomical or psychological changes of aging alone. Fecal incontinence leads to a high economic burden to the healthcare system and is an important cause of institutionalization. In addition, fecal incontinence is associated with shame, social isolation and reduced quality of life. The importance of identifying treatable causes in the frail elderly is strongly emphasized. It is recommended that an assessment of fecal incontinence should be implemented as part of an evaluation of older patients. Although there is a substantial evidence base to guide choice of implementation activities targeting healthcare professionals, little implementation research has focused on the care of older people nor involved care processes or care personnel. This study is based on the assumption that fecal incontinence among nursing home patients can be prevented, cured or ameliorated by offering care staff knowledge of best practice through a multifaceted educational program. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that a multifaceted educational program for nursing home care staff on assessment and treatment of fecal incontinence reduces patients' frequency of fecal incontinence. Methods/design: The study is a two-armed, parallel cluster-randomized controlled trial. Primary outcome is the frequency of fecal incontinence among patients. Sample size calculations resulted in a need for a total sample of 240 patients. Twenty nursing home units in one city in Norway will be recruited and allocated to intervention or control by an independent statistician using computer-generated tables. The intervention is a multifaceted educational program. Units in the control arm will provide care as usual. The intervention period is 3 months. Data will be collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Data will be analyzed using mixed effect models with the cluster treated as a random effect. Discussion: This study is the first randomized controlled trial specifically focusing on this neglected area. The result of the study will give evidence for best practice for continence care in nursing homes, and organizational advice concerning implementation strategies.

"To risk or not to risk? improving financial risk-Taking of older adults by online social information. Increasing number of older adults manage their retirement savings online. A crucial element of better management is to take rational financial risk - to strike a reasonable balance between expected gain and loss under uncertainty. With the emergence of Web 2.0 technologies, social trading networks can help individuals make better financial decisions by providing information about others' actions. It is, however, unclear whether these resources is beneficial to older adult's own financial decisions, especially because older adults are vulnerable to poor risk management. To address this question, we devise an experiment that improves upon an existing experimental economic task. We find that both peer information (detailed choices by a few individuals) and majority information (aggregated choices of the crowd) help older adults make more risk-neutral decisions. Furthermore, the combination of peer and majority information corrects more mistakes of more riskaverse older adults. © 2015 ACM.",1,0,0,0
"Happiness and social exclusion of indigenous peoples in Taiwan - A social sustainability perspective. Introduction: Happiness and social inclusion are important indicators of social sustainability, as recommended in the Sustainable Development Goals; however, little is known about the social sustainable development of ethnic minorities. To fill this knowledge gap, special attention is paid to understanding the issues of social exclusion and happiness in relation to the indigenous peoples in Taiwan. Methods: Data used were drawn from a nationwide representativeness survey of the Taiwanese Indigenous People in 2007; it included 2,200 respondents. This study employed binary logistic regression to examine the effects of different domains of social exclusion on the likelihood of perceiving happiness; other exogenous factors, were controlled. Results: The results show that among the respondents, mountain indigenous peoples, females, the elderly and those who are healthier, wealthier, highly educated, possessing western beliefs, and are more likely to be happy, compared to their counterparts. As expected, the results reveal that the likelihood of being happy is higher for those who have received medical benefits, as well as those persons without housing problems or financial difficulties, compared to their excluded counterparts. However, no significant association is found between happiness and some social exclusion domains, such as child and youth benefits, and unemployment benefits. Conclusions: The disengagement of the indigenous peoples in mainstream society, with respect to the accessibility of welfare provisions, is a crucial element in regard to social exclusion and happiness. Several policy implications for the social sustainability of indigenous peoples can be inferred from these findings. For example, providing a mobile clinical tour, on-site health counseling, or homecare service can contribute to the removal of institutional and geographic barriers to medical welfare provisions for the mountain indigenes. Moreover, the government may devote more welfare resources to assist indigenous families and tribal communities to develop their own social safety net, instead of the individual-oriented welfare provisions. © 2015 Jiun-Hao Wang.",0,0,0,1
"Return to work in sick-listed cancer survivors with job loss: Design of a randomised controlled trial. Background: Despite long-term or permanent health problems, cancer survivors are often motivated to return to work. For cancer survivors who have lost their job, return to work can be more challenging compared to employed survivors, as they generally find themselves in a more vulnerable social and financial position. Cancer survivors with job loss may therefore be in need of tailored return to work support. However, there is a lack of return to work intervention programs specifically targeting these cancer survivors. The number of cancer survivors with job loss in developed countries is rising due to, amongst others, increases in the incidence and survivor rate of cancer, the retirement age and the proportion of flexible employment contracts. Hence, we consider it important to develop a tailored return to work intervention program for cancer survivors with job loss, and to evaluate its effectiveness compared to usual care. Methods/Design: This study employs a two-armed randomised controlled trial with a follow-up period of 12 months. The study population (n=164) will be recruited from a national sample of cancer survivors (18-60 years), who have been sick-listed for 12-36 months. Participants will be randomised by using computerized blocked randomisation (blocks of four). All participants will receive usual care as provided by the Dutch Social Security Agency. Additionally, participants in the intervention group will receive a tailored return to work intervention program, which includes vocational rehabilitation and supportive psychosocial components, as well as (therapeutic) placement at work. The primary outcome measure is duration until sustainable return to work; the secondary outcome measure is rate of return to work. Other parameters include, amongst others, fatigue, coping strategy and quality of life. We will perform Cox regression analyses to estimate hazard ratios for time to sustainable return to work. Discussion: The hypothesis of this study is that a tailored approach for cancer survivors with job loss is more effective, regarding return to work, compared to usual care. The results of this study will provide insight into the ways in which return to work can be facilitated for cancer survivors with job loss.

"Personalized Technology to Support Older Adults with and Without Cognitive Impairment Living at Home. Although persons with dementia (PWD) and their family caregivers need in-home support for common neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), few if any assistive technologies are available to help manage NPS. This implementation study tested the feasibility and adoption of a touch screen technology, the Companion, which delivers psychosocial, nondrug interventions to PWD in their home to address individual NPS and needs. Interventions were personalized and delivered in home for a minimum of 3 weeks. Postintervention measures indicated the technology was easy to use, significantly facilitated meaningful and positive engagement, and simplified caregivers' daily lives. Although intervention goals were met, caregivers had high expectations of their loved one's ability to regain independence. Care recipients used the system independently but were limited by cognitive and physical impairments. We conclude the Companion can help manage NPS and offer caregiver respite at home. These data provide important guidance for design and deployment of care technology for the home. © The Author(s) 2015.",0,1,0,0
"A robot of my own: Participatory design of socially assistive robots for independently living older adults diagnosed with depression. This paper presents an ongoing project using participatory design methods to develop design concepts for socially assistive robots (SARs) with older adults diagnosed with depression and co-occurring physical illness. We frame SARs development in the context of preventive patient-centered healthcare, which empowers patients as the primary drivers of health and aims to delay the onset of disease rather than focusing on treatment. After describing how SARs can be of benefit in this form of healthcare, we detail our participatory design study with older adults and therapists aimed at developing preventive SARs applications for this population. We found therapists and older adults to be willing and able to participate in assistive robot design, though hands-on participation was a challenge. Our findings suggest that important areas of concern for older adults with depression are social interaction and companionship, as well as technologies that are easy to use and require minimal intervention. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",1,0,0,0
"Assessing physical and cognitive function of older adults in continuing care retirement communities: Who are we recruiting?. Purpose: In partnership with six Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs), the current study focused on the feasibility of recruiting a representative sample of residents and then assessing their functional health. Material and Methods: With our guidance, each of the six CCRCs recruited a volunteer (V-Group) and random (R-Group) sample of independent living residents. We provided face-to-face training and ongoing remote electronic support to the CCRC staff on the testing battery and the Web-based data entry system. The testing battery was consisted of demographic, physical function, and psychosocial assessments. Results: After training, CCRC staff were receptive to the study goals and successfully used the data entry Website. In the V-Group (N = 189), 76% were already participating in CCRC wellness programs. We attempted to recruit a random, unbiased (R-Group) sample of 20% (n = 105) of eligible residents; however, only 30 consented to be tested and 70% of this group (21/30) were also already participating in a wellness program. Mean age of all participants was 82.9. years. The V-Group had a higher Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) total score (least squares mean [SE], 9.4 [0.2] vs 8.2 [0.4], p = 0.014) and SPPB gait speed component score (3.5 [0.1] vs 3.0 [0.2], p = 0.007) and spent more time doing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (300 [21] vs 163 [49] min/week, p = 0.013) compared to the R-Group. Implications: While it is feasible to recruit, assess and transmit data on residents' functional health in partnership with CCRCs, population validity was severely compromised. Attention needs to be given to the development of more effective methods to recruit less interested residents. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",1,1,1,1
"Prototyping TV and tablet facebook interfaces for older adults. With the daily problem of social isolation comes an aggravation of older adults’ general health. Social Network Services like Facebook have the potential to ameliorate the social connectivity of this segment of the population. However, they are still not fully adopted by them, whether because of age-related limitations or the lack of appropriate technological skills. In this paper we argue that the development of SNSs based on technology already used by older adults, like Television, or technology which has proven to be more accessible to them, like Tablets, can improve the ability of older adults to use these systems. We report findings from a study composed of semi-structured interviews and focus groups which aimed at the development of two Facebook-based prototypes for TV and Tablet. Results show good receptiveness from older adults to perform social tasks on TV and Tablet-based applications, for interacting using alternative modalities like speech, or back-of-device tapping, and for the use of adaptation mechanisms. Informed by the study results the main contributions are the two prototypes, and a collection of recommendations regarding the design of TV and tablet based interfaces for this population. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.",1,0,0,0
"Using social network analysis to assess mentorship and collaboration in a public health network. Introduction Addressing chronic disease burden requires the creation of collaborative networks to promote systemic changes and engage stakeholders. Although many such networks exist, they are rarely assessed with tools that account for their complexity. This study examined the structure of mentorship and collaboration relationships among members of the Healthy Aging Research Network (HAN) using social network analysis (SNA). Methods We invited 97 HAN members and partners to complete an online social network survey that included closed-ended questions about HAN-specific mentorship and collaboration during the previous 12 months. Collaboration was measured by examining the activity of the network on 6 types of products: published articles, in-progress manuscripts, grant applications, tools, research projects, and presentations. We computed network-level measures such as density, number of components, and centralization to assess the cohesiveness of the network. Results Sixty-three respondents completed the survey (response rate, 65%). Responses, which included information about collaboration with nonrespondents, suggested that 74% of HAN members were connected through mentorship ties and that all 97 members were connected through at least one form of collaboration. Mentorship and collaboration ties were present both within and across boundaries of HAN member organizations. Conclusion SNA of public health collaborative networks provides understanding about the structure of relationships that are formed as a result of participation in network activities. This approach may offer members and funders a way to assess the impact of such networks that goes beyond simply measuring products and participation at the individual level.",0,0,0,1
"Technology for Older Adults: Maximising Personal and Social Interaction: Exploring Opportunities for eHealth to Support the Older Rural Population with Chronic Pain. eHealth technologies are being promoted by government as an integral part of the future delivery of health and social care services. Demographic ageing is most pronounced in rural areas and eHealth technologies could support care models designed to help the growing number of rural older people living independently in their own homes. Successful deployment of eHealth technologies will depend on a number of factors, including older adults’ receptiveness to and ability to use new technologies. Using a mixed-methods approach we report findings from a survey of Pain Association Scotland members, home visit observations, qualitative interviews with rural older adults with chronic pain and their health and social care providers. We report that rural older adults with chronic pain are receptive to eHealth technologies but caution that these technologies need to be designed and deployed with the needs of specific patient groups in mind. Patients and professionals do not think that opportunities for in-person interaction should be replaced by technology. We suggest that care needs to be taken to ensure that an appropriate balance between the use of eHealth technologies and in-person care is struck. © 2015 The Author(s).

"Can playing massive multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) help older adults?. Gerontology researchers have demonstrated that social interaction has profound impacts on the psychological wellbeing of older adults. This paper addresses the question of whether and how playing Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) help older adults. We analyzed the relationships of older adults' social interactions in Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) to three social-psychological factors (i.e., loneliness, depression and social support). A total of 176 web surveys were usable from the 222 respondents aged 55 years or more who played World of Warcraft and were recruited online to complete the survey. It was found that enjoyment of relationships and quality of guild play had strong impacts on older adults' social and emotional wellbeing. Specifically, higher enjoyment of relationships was related to higher social support as well as lower levels of loneliness. Higher quality of guild play was related to higher levels of social support and lower levels of loneliness and depression.",0,0,0,0
"Older adults and the appropriation and disappropriation of smartphones. Research in recent years has focused on examining the acceptance as well as the appropriation of technologies amongst older adults, especially in how technologies alleviate issues of functional declines, loneliness, and financial difficulties brought about by ageing. Yet such studies have often overlooked meaningful appropriation or disappropriation of technologies amongst older adults. By drawing on a longitudinal study of ten older adults who were given a smartphone under a corporate social responsibility program by a telecommunications company, we followed the use of smartphones by ten older adult users using in-depth interviews lasting one to two hours each. Our findings revealed a mix of appropriation and disappropriation, which are linked to everyday technological use and routines, attitudes to technology, and social support. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",1,0,0,0
"Togetherness in another way: Internet as a tool for togetherness in everyday occupations among older adults. Objective: This article explores and describes how the Internet was experienced as a tool for togetherness in everyday occupations among older adults. Methods: Discussions with 12 older adults, divided into three focus groups, generated data that were analysed using a grounded theory approach. Six women and six men between 67 and 79 years of age were purposively selected and recruited from a retirement organization in northern Sweden. Results: Findings reflect how online contexts generated new possibilities for togetherness in everyday occupations and created a sense of belonging with others and to society at large. However, togetherness through the Internet was also associated with ambiguity and uncertainty among older adults. The Internet provided opportunities for togetherness that were somehow different from togetherness derived from face-to-face contact, but it was also connected with a fear and a resistance. Conclusions: Findings from this research can extend our understanding of how online contexts have the possibility to promote togetherness in everyday occupations and what it means to be part of such a context among older adults. In light of these findings, the need is highlighted to consider the Internet as a tool for older adults to be socially engaged with the potential to reduce loneliness and isolation. © 2015 © Informa Healthcare.",1,0,0,1
"Getting Grandma Online: Are Tablets the Answer for Increasing Digital Inclusion for Older Adults in the U.S.?. Using information and communication technologies (ICTs) can improve older adults’ quality of life. ICT use is associated with decreased feelings of loneliness and depression, along with increased feelings of independence and personal growth. However, limited access and low technological self-efficacy are key reasons why some groups, especially older adults, are excluded from being fully engaged in the digital world. In this study, we focus on older adults’ technological self-efficacy, which is related to their actual use of technology and the second level digital divide. Specifically, we examine: (a) how older adults decide to use a new technology, tablet computers; (b) how they conquer the barrier of technological self-efficacy through using tablets; and (c) the impacts of using this new technology in their lives. Twenty-one in-depth interviews were conducted with older adults residing in independent living communities in a medium-sized city in the Deep South region of the United States. Observational and enactive learning played important roles for older adults in using tablets. Seeing others use tablets, getting recommendations from family members, or having tablets given to them were the primary reasons they started to use tablet computers. The ease of use feature of tablets helped solve the problem of lacking technological self-efficacy. Using tablets helped increase a sense of connectedness. Tablet computers may be one way to increase digital inclusion among older adults. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1,0,0,0
"The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments. Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",1,1,1,1
"Intuitive learnability of touch gestures for technology-naïve older adults. Touch-based interactions, if intuitive and natural, should be highly learnable. However, the learnability of touch gestures as a computer interaction modality cannot be taken for granted and should be evaluated empirically. This is especially true when technology-naïve older adults are concerned, given the psychological and physical constraints associated with this age range. To investigate this issue, we conducted a study with 17 technology-naïve older adults, whose experience with technology was mostly limited to making calls with mobile phones. Specifically, the participants were presented with three simple digital games on an interactive tabletop surface and asked to play the games on their own with minimal instruction or help. The first two games required the use of a drag gesture whereas the third game required the use of a rotate gesture. The main research question was whether the older adults could learn the gestures effectively and efficiently. A set of variables such as task duration and gesture accuracy were measured. Results showed that the learnability of a drag gesture was relatively high and that the participants could transfer this skill across the games. In contrast, the learnability of a rotate gesture was low and most of the participants failed to demonstrate any improvement over the tasks of the game. These findings partially corroborate those of earlier work. Implications for future work are drawn, especially exploring the potential of social interactions between older adults for enhancing the learning effects. © The Author 2014.

"Factors influencing the Thai elderly's intention to use social network for Quality of Life: A case study LINE application. The structure of the population pyramid has changed because of the rapid rise in the amount of population aged 60 years or over. Many regions of the world are moving into an aging society. Meanwhile, the information society is a society today; everything is connected to the internet. Social Networks play a huge role in the daily lives of many young people. Furthermore, there are also many older people who are interested in learning and using the same social networks. This study aimed to investigate the factors that influence the Thai elderly's intention to use the LINE application for Quality of Life. This study was developed by integrating the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This empirical research model used survey data from 434 elderly participants in Thailand. All six research hypotheses were positively supported. The results indicated that the factor most associated with behavioral intention to use the LINE application in the elderly for quality of life was Performance Expectancy and Effort Expectancy. In addition, the study also indicated that when the elderly's behavioral intention in using the LINE application could predict the relationship and improve the quality of life 30.7%. Moreover, the study suggests that the elderly with behavioral intention to use the LINE application affect the Quality of Life at a moderate level. The use of the LINE application for the elderly can play a part in promoting and developing their quality of life. © 2015 IEEE.",1,0,0,0
"Design considerations for technology interventions to support social and physical wellness for older adults with disability. Social and physical wellness are important considerations for maintaining one's health into older age and remaining independent. However, some segments of the older adult population, such as those aging with disability, are at increased risk for loneliness and reduced physical activity, which could result in negative health consequences. There is a critical need to understand how to deploy social and physical wellness interventions for people aging with disability. We provide an overview of constructs related to social and physical wellness, as well as evidence-based interventions effective with older populations. Our review yields considerations for how interventions may need to be developed or modified to be efficacious for this population segment. Technology may be a key component in adopting interventions, particularly tele-technologies, which we define and discuss in depth. © 2015 International Journal of Automation and Smart Technology.",0,0,0,0
"eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults. Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",1,0,0,1
"Ethics in Evaluating a Sociotechnical Intervention with Socially Isolated Older Adults. The purpose of this article is to consider how ethical principles can inform the effective design and implementation of technology-based interventions that aim to promote the well-being of socially isolated older adults. We evaluated a new iPad application with small groups of older adults. In this article, we reflect on the ethical issues encountered at each stage of the research process. Drawing on the ethical principles of beneficence, research merit and integrity, justice, and respect, we identify key issues to consider in the future design and implementation of social isolation interventions that use new technologies. Key issues include (a) providing sufficient support to facilitate ongoing social interactions, (b) managing older adults' expectations, (c) providing encouragement without coercion, and (d) responding to individual needs. We conclude that it is important to report on ethical challenges incurred when evaluating social isolation interventions to inform future research in this important area. © SAGE Publications.",1,0,0,0
"Training Effects on Older Adults in Information and Communication Technologies Considering Psychosocial Variables. The main aim of this study is to contribute knowledge about the impact of the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) on the self-concept, mood, and quality of life of institutionalized older adults in retirement homes and day care centers (Portuguese institutions). It also studies the influence of independent variables such as age; education; referral to the institution (own initiative, indicated by friends, indicated by family, indicated by social security); attendance schedule; and visits from family and friends. The study comprised 41 participants organized into two groups: 22 older adults in the ICT Group and 19 older adults in the Passive Control Group. There were three evaluation periods: before the onset of intervention and 11 and 22 months after intervention began. The results demonstrate that involvement with information and communication technologies produced positive effects on older adults’ social behavior and their self-perception of physical and environment facets of quality of life. Moreover, they suggest that there is a relationship between psychosocial variables and independent variables. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1,1,1,0
"Internet Use and Well-Being in Older Adults. The Internet has become an important social context in the lives of older adults. Extant research has focused on the use of the Internet and how it influences well-being. However, conflicting findings exist. The purpose of the study was to develop an integrative research model in order to determine the nature of the relationships among Internet use, loneliness, social support, life satisfaction, and psychological well-being. Specifically, loneliness and social support were tested as potential mediators that may modify the relationship between Internet use and indicators of well-being. Data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS) were used, and the association among Internet use, social support, loneliness, life satisfaction, and psychological well-being was explored. The sample consisted of 5,203 older adults (aged 65 years and older). The results indicated that higher levels of Internet use were significant predictors of higher levels of social support, reduced loneliness, and better life satisfaction and psychological well-being among older adults. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",1,0,0,0
"Mediating asymmetries in family communication: Supporting the eInclusion of older adults. Background: The rise of mobile Web-based technologies has diversified the mechanisms used by people to socialize, which results in issues in family communication. Among these concerns, the reluctance of older adults to use digital media may cause them social isolation, leading to negative effects in their physical and mental health. Objective: This paper aims to formalize a model to mediate asymmetries in cross-generational communication and support the eInclusion of older adults. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews to the members of 20 cross-generational families. Following the grounded theory approach, we identified emerging themes regarding asymmetries in family communication practices when older adults are involved. We then derived and formalized computer-based mediation strategies using a model-driven engineering approach. Results: We identified three main sources of asymmetries: (1) implicit family agreements in terms of social interaction, (2) capability and preferences for using particular media, and (3) unbalanced socio-affective coupling between the involved parties. The proposed model addresses these asymmetries and provides strategies to coordinate the communication effort of family members with their elders. Conclusions: By using the proposed model, designers of software that supports family communities can conceive effective mechanisms to coordinate and mediate social communication among cross-generational family members through digital means. This allows the elderly to show a better reaction to digital media, thus facilitating their acceptance and appropriation of information technologies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",1,0,0,1
"Social networks and lifelong learning in older people [Redes sociales y formación permanente en personas mayores]. Various socio-demographic factors are causing our society to coexist every day with a group of elderly population that remains active and inserted into the daily dynamics. However, it is believed that there are certain barriers that make this group of people to not adequately address the technologies and even social networks. The creation of the University Programs for the Elderly (PUM), however, is leading to a new stage, since older people who participate come into contact with all kinds of content and rigor, updating own university education, thus changing the way to tackle the most innovative and different situations. In this study, we analyze what is the knowledge and use of older people, PUM, attending the University of Jaen have of the social networks and the assessment made of the need for these programs. To achieve this, we used a methodology in which qualitative and quantitative processes were articulated, through the analysis of data obtained from interviews and a focus groups with program Aquad 7. The data collected show that there is still some ignorance about social networks by older people, but everyone values their usefulness and necessity.

Social networking as a percentage has been steadily increasing among all age groups including seniors. While the elderly may develop varying physical discrepancies such as auditory and optic complications these should not hinder their abilities to utilize social media devices. Not only does social networking allow for spontaneous intercommunication but for the elderly it can benefit overall wellbeing of the participants. Additionally, physical dexterity may be improved through continued use. It has been readily accepted that lifelong learning can lead to a decrease in mental decrepitude.

"Nearer to being characters in a book': How older people make sense of online communities and social networking sites. This study looked at the relationship between local and online forms of community engagement for a small group of older people in the South of England. Interviews and a focus group were used to establish their understandings of online community and social networking sites (SNS) within the context of existing relationships in local communities. Past experiences of local community influenced expectations for online community and its authenticity. At the same time four catalysts were identified which motivated engagement with community resources both online and locally. These were: 'spaces and places', family, roles and loss. A sense of 'real' community was maintained through meeting people face to face with online communities and SNS being used predominantly as tools for achieving this aim. Exploration of the catalysts offers ways that greater community involvement might be further facilitated through design initiatives that make online community feel more 'real' to older users. © 2015 IEEE.",1,0,0,0
"The correlation among social interaction activities registered through new technologies and elderly's social isolation level [Correlación entre Actividades de Interacción Social Registradas con Nuevas Tecnologías y el grado de Aislamiento Social en los Adultos Mayores]. Social isolation is a condition that endangers the physical and mental integrity of the elderly. To mitigate this problem, there are computational approaches that encourage socialization through social interaction activities based on elderly's communication and mobility. However, few studies provide statistical evidence about the influence of the social interaction activities with the elderly's social isolation level. Therefore, the goal of this research work is to identify social interaction activities that have statistically significant association with elderly?s social isolation level. The results indicate that the social interaction activities based phone calls through the mobile phone have an inverse correlation with social isolation level. In contrast, the social interaction activities based on the time spent inside home have a direct correlation. From the identified activities, it is possible to develop computer systems capable of providing timely warnings of social isolation in older adults. This early warnings and appropriate interventions can reduce the risk of depression, cognitive impairment or impoverishment of the social network, thus improving the quality of life of elderly.",1,0,0,0
"Robot interface design: The giraff telepresence robot for social interaction. This paper presents the outcome of the Workshop on Robot Interface Design, which was held in Genoa (Italy) over the months of January and February 2014 and was jointly organized by Polytechnic School at the University of Genoa and the National Research Council.Â The aim of the workshop was to study the design of physical, functional and graphical interfaces for a telepresence assistive robot, starting from the analysis of the current features of a commercial robot called Giraff (http://www.giraff.org). The fielding of the Giraff robot has been studied (within an EU-funded AAL project: ExCITE— http://www.excite-project.eu) in three different European countries as an ICT solution to support elderly people and to enhance social interaction with relatives and caregivers. The evaluation with real end-users of the Giraff brought to light a set of user requirements and issues to be improved in the robotic platform. This workshop sought to present the aspects connected to the design (in which participants had specific expertise), and to the users perception of the robot within a domestic environment. Particular attention was paid to the design of volumes, shapes and anthropometric relationships as well as elaborations on chromatic aspects and the exploitation of different kinds of material. Some of the main results of the workshop were: a design process involving different professionals such as designers, engineers and psychologists working in close contact with a group of end-users; a set of possible modifications/extensions of the robotic platform; a set of new design concepts featuring a higher level of product emotionality. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",0,0,0,0
"An extended view on benefits and barriers of ambient assisted living solutions. Motivated by the older adults' desire to age in their trusted home environment and the increasing financial pressure on the healthcare system, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies are designed to facilitate healthy and autonomous aging in place.

"The personalized reminder information and social management system (PRISM) trial: Rationale, methods and baseline characteristics. Technology holds promise in terms of providing support to older adults. To date, there have been limited robust systematic efforts to evaluate the psychosocial benefits of technology for older people and identify factors that influence both the usability and uptake of technology systems. In response to these issues, we developed the Personal Reminder Information and Social Management System (PRISM), a software application designed for older adults to support social connectivity, memory, knowledge about topics, leisure activities and access to resources. This trail is evaluating the impact of access to the PRISM system on outcomes such as social isolation, social support and connectivity. This paper reports on the approach used to design the PRISM system, study design, methodology and baseline data for the trial. The trial is multi-site randomized field trial. PRISM is being compared to a Binder condition where participants received a binder that contained content similar to that found on PRISM. The sample includes 300 older adults, aged 65-98. years, who lived alone and at risk for being isolated. The primary outcome measures for the trial include indices of social isolation and support and well-being. Secondary outcomes measures include indices of computer proficiency, technology uptake and attitudes towards technology. Follow-up assessments occurred at 6 and 12. months post-randomization. The results of this study will yield important information about the potential value of technology for older adults. The study also demonstrates how a user-centered iterative design approach can be incorporated into the design and evaluation of an intervention protocol. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",1,1,1,0
"Urban Social and Built Environments and Trajectories of Decline in Social Engagement in Vulnerable Elders: Findings From Detroit’s Medicaid Home and Community-Based Waiver Population. There is little knowledge on the relationships between neighborhood environments and trajectories of social engagement among physically and economically vulnerable older adults. We examined the association between neighborhood social and built environments (physical disorder, the presence of crime watch signs, and street conditions) and 36-month trajectories of social engagement among 965 older adults living in Detroit, Michigan. Social withdrawal was defined as a decline in social engagement without distress while social isolation was defined as a decline in social engagement with distress. We utilized data from Michigan’s Minimum Data Set for Home Care (2000–2008), merged with contextual data collected through a virtual audit instrument using Google Earth’s “Street View” feature. Results from multilevel multinomial analyses indicated that the presence of neighborhood watch signs was associated with increased chance of social withdrawal and social isolation among frail older adults over time, highlighting the potential anxiety-provoking effect of precautionary measures against crime. © The Author(s) 2014",1,0,0,0

The iCarer project (AAL-2012-5-239) proposes the design and implementation of a cloud-inspired personalised and adaptive platform which will offer support to informal carers of older adults with cognitive impairment. By means of a holistic approach comprising technologies and services addressing the intelligent and interactive monitoring of activities, knowledge management for personalised guidance and orientation, virtual interaction, e-learning, care coordination facilities and social network services, iCarer aims to reduce the informal carer stress and to enhance the quality of care they provide, thus improving their quality of life. The iCarer platform will be evaluated through a multi-centre non-controlled study (4 months; 48 homes located in England and in Slovenia). Currently the iCarer project is completing the development work. The evaluation trial is expected to start in August 2015. © 2015 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI).",0,0,0,0
"Access to new information and communication technologies among homeless people in madrid (spain). The article analyzes access to various information and communication technologies (ICTs; mobile phone, computer, Internet, e-mail, and social network sites) among a representative sample of homeless people in Madrid. The information was collected using a structured interview. The results show that new ICTs are used to some extent among homeless people in Madrid, although at much lower percentages than the general population in Spain. We observed a relatively widespread use of mobile phones, a medium-low level use of the Internet, computer, and e-mail, and hardly any use of social networks, with significant differences according to the interviewees' age, level of education, and Spanish or foreign nationality. The digital divide has an especially negative effect on elderly homeless people, those with lower levels of education, and those of Spanish origin. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0,0,0,0
"Physiotherapists' perceived motivators and barriers for organizing physical activity for older long-term care facility residents. Background: Information regarding factors that hinder or stimulate older adults in long-term care facilities (LTCF) for being physically active is available in the literature, but much less is known regarding perceived motivators and barriers among physiotherapists (PTs) to organize physical activity (PA) in LTCF. Objective: The main purpose of this study was to examine factors influencing PTs to organize PA in LTCF for older adults. A secondary goal was to examine the PTs' knowledge about and their barriers at the PA guidelines for older adults of the World Health Organization (WHO). Methods: A mixed qualitative and quantitative study was carried out using semistructured interviews (n=24) followed by an online survey (n=254). As a frame the social-ecological model (McLeroy) was used, distinguishing factors at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community level. Results: In the qualitative component the PTs reported 41 motivators and 35 barriers for organizing PA in LTCF. The survey revealed that although the majority of the respondents (71%) are convinced of the usefulness of PA in LTCF, 84% are not familiar with the WHO-guidelines. Seventy-five percent of the respondents believe that the WHO-guidelines are not feasible for LTCF-residents. The strongest motivators on the intrapersonal level were maintaining the independence of the residents (98%), reducing the risk of falling (98%), and improving the physical (93%) and psychological (90%) wellbeing of LTCF-residents. The social interaction among LTCF-residents (91%) during PA was the strongest motivator on the interpersonal level. Motivators on the community level are the belief that PA is the basis of their physiotherapeutic work (89%) and that offering varied activities avoids PA becoming monotonous (71%). Barriers on the intra- and interpersonal level were of less influence. On the community level, they felt hindered to organize PA because of lack of time (38%) and the overload of paperwork (33%). Conclusions: This study described different motivators and barriers for PTs to organize PA in LTCFs. The majority does not know the WHO guidelines regarding the amount of PA for adults aged 65 and over. Although they agree that the guidelines are useful, they believe the guidelines are not feasible. There is a need for a multifactorial strategy that acts on different determinants in order to stimulate PA in LTCF. © 2015 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",0,0,0,1
"Designing for suburban social inclusion: A case of geo-located storytelling. This article showcases a digital solution for strengthening social inclusion and well-being of senior suburban residents of a socially diverse Finnish town. The study is framed as design research where research is conducted in order to feed into a design process. A background study was first conducted in order to identify the target group's needs, abilities, and attitudes towards the neighbourhood. The results revealed positive attitudes towards the area and the need for relatedness, autonomy, competence, pleasure and stimulation, physical thriving and security. Following a User-Centered Design process we based our design choices on these results and developed a local geocaching solution incorporating storytelling. The aim was to encourage senior citizens to socialize, be physically active and to experience the local urban place. An interview-based evaluation with older adults (n=6) combined with an analysis of online cache log data, showed positive experiences of the solution.",1,0,0,0
"Easisocial: An innovative way of increasing adoption of social media in older people. Online Social Networking has become one of the biggest successes of the Internet. Facebook is the most popular service with over 1.23 billion users. Online Social Networks have the potential to combat feelings of social isolation amongst the aging population. Nevertheless, many older people do not use online social networks given the barriers resulting from a lack of understanding and perceived usefulness. This paper presents the findings from a ten week training course were participants were trained in the use of Facebook and EasiSocial, a newly introduced web application which displays Facebook in a manner which is more suitable for older people. An evaluation study was undertaken of both applications in an effort to gain insight into the reasons why older people (50–80 years old) do not use social media. Findings demonstrated that EasiSocial was statistically easier to learn and easier to use than Facebook and therefore potentially helpful to increase the adoption of Social Media technologies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",0,1,0,0
"Translating Training in the NYU Caregiver Intervention in Australia: Maintaining Fidelity and Meeting Graduate Standards in an Online Continuing Professional Education Setting. The aim of this study was to develop an Internet-based self-directed training program for Australian healthcare workers to facilitate learning and competence in delivery of a proven intervention for caregivers of people with dementia: The New York University Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI). The NYUCI is a nonpharmacological, multicomponent intervention for spousal caregivers. It is aimed at maintaining well-being by increasing social support and decreasing family discord, thereby delaying or avoiding nursing home placement of the person with dementia. Training in the NYUCI in the United States has, until now, been conducted in person to trainee practitioners. The Internet-based intervention was developed simultaneously for trainees in the U.S. and Australia. In Australia, due to population geography, community healthcare workers, who provide support to older adult caregivers of people with dementia, live and work in many regional and rural areas. Therefore, it was especially important to have online training available to make it possible to realize the health and economic benefits of using an existing evidence-based intervention. This study aimed to transfer knowledge of training in, and delivery of, the NYUCI for an Australian context and consumers. This article details the considerations given to contextual differences and to learners’ skillset differences in translating the NYUCI for Australia. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0,0,0,0
"End-of-life characteristics and palliative care provision for elderly patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia. Purpose: End-of-life care characteristics and palliative care (PC) utilization of elderly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients have rarely been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cause of death, place of death and PC utilization of older adults (age 60 years or above) suffering from AML.Methods: Patients were recruited retrospectively from two hematology units in Hong Kong, which consisted of one university department with Bone Marrow Transplant service, and one regional hospital with hematology specialty service. Collaboration with PC unit was established. Elderly AML patients referred to PC service were included. Medical records of all identified patients would be reviewed retrospectively by two PC physicians.Results: From October 2011 to April 2013, 156 hematological cancer patients were referred for PC; 43 elderly AML patients were included into data analysis. The median time from AML diagnosis to death was 9.1 months. Up to 46.5 % patients received supportive care alone since diagnosis. More than half of elderly AML patients died in acute ward and hematology units (53.5 %), while 30.2 % died in PC settings. Overall, 51.2 % of patients spent the whole period of their final month of life in-hospital. Infection-related diagnoses contributed to 51.2 % of deaths. Median time from AML diagnosis to first PC consultation was 1.0 month. PC service includes psychosocial support (100 %), hospice in-patient care (30.2 %), homecare (60.5 %), PC outpatient clinic (14.0 %) and bereavement care (93.0 %).Conclusions: Elderly AML patients carry dismal prognosis with their final phase of disease mostly hospitalized in acute care settings. Infections and bleeding could complicate course of illness and lead to rapid deterioration. PC collaboration remains important in psychosocial support and coverage of dying AML patients in non-hospice settings. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",1,0,0,1
"Consumer attitude towards sustainable-labelled wine: an exploratory approach. Purpose – This paper aims to investigate, using an exploratory approach, how environmental values and beliefs about sustainable labelling shape consumer attitude towards sustainable wine. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected with an online survey from 495 Italian wine drinkers in 2013. The survey was advertised through websites, blogs, social networks and emails. Based on background research and literature review, ten hypotheses were tested. Then a structural equation model was constructed using latent variables to test the causal links specified in the model. Findings – The results show that attitude towards sustainable-labelled wine is shaped by both environmental and quality beliefs about sustainable wine, while it is not affected by the economic dimension of sustainability. In addition, age appears to have a slight effect on attitude because young consumers seem to be more interested in sustainability aspects of food products than older people are. Practical implications – The paper suggests that company communication strategies should focus on sustainable issues to meet the requirements of environmentally conscious consumers. At the same time, sustainable certification on wine labels may help wineries to become more competitive using verifiable sustainable claims to differentiate their products. Originality/value – The work adds to the literature on wine marketing by evaluating which variables influence consumer attitude towards sustainable-labelled wine and, at the same time, to what extent sustainable aspects are important during wine purchase. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",0,0,0,1
"Protecting confidentiality in a study of adolescents’ digital communication. Studying digital communication provides “a window into the secret world of adolescent peer culture” (Greenfield and Yan, 2006, p. 392). According to large, national surveys, 73% of teens (ages 12 to 17) use social networking sites (Lenhart, Purcell, Smith, and Zickuhr, 2010); 51% of teens check social networking sites daily and 22% check them more than 10 times per day (Common Sense Media, 2009). Youth ages 12 to 17 report sending an average of 60 text messages per day (Lenhart, 2012). Many teenagers claim that their social lives would end or be seriously impaired if they could not have access to text messaging (54% of girls and 40% of boys; CTIA, 2008). This case study describes an ethical dilemma that arose in the context of an ongoing longitudinal study called the BlackBerry Project, in which adolescents were given BlackBerry devices configured to save all of their incoming and outgoing text messages to a secure online archive for later coding and analysis (Underwood, Rosen, More, Ehrenreich, and Gentsch, 2012). Adolescents and their families had been participating in a study of origins and outcomes of aggression since the third grade, and prior to starting ninth grade they were given the BlackBerry devices as a way of investigating their social aggression in the context of digital communication. Following the ethical principle of informed consent, participants and their parents knew text messages sent and received on the BlackBerries were being monitored and archived. Participants were promised confidentiality with regard to content of their digital communication, with a few important exceptions. In keeping with our ethical responsibility to protect our participants from doing harm to self or others, participants understood the limits of confidentiality - that we would alert parents and the appropriate authorities if we saw any text messaging that indicated child or elder abuse, suicidality, or intent to harm others. We obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality that protected us from being required to report other illegal behaviors; participants and parents were informed that we would not report antisocial activities, to them or to any other authorities. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",0,0,0,0
"Cross-cultural Perspectives of Successful Aging: Young Turks and Europeans. Successful aging (SA) has been conceptualized in a number of ways. Despite increasing research into how laypersons define SA, few studies capturing lay perspectives of SA in younger cohorts and in non-English speaking countries have been undertaken. The current study examines cross-cultural perspectives of SA in young (aged 18–35), lay adults from a variety of continental European countries and Turkey. Participants were recruited via snowball sampling from social network sites and invited to participate in an online survey. Persons between 18–35 years from Belgium, Estonia, Germany, Netherlands, Romania, Switzerland, or Turkey were included. Respondents (total: 390; Belgian: 32; Estonian: 96; German: 76; Romanian: 47; Swiss: 39; Dutch: 30; Turkish: 70), were primarily women (56.4%) and students (66.2%), with an average age of 24.1 years (SD 3.7). Personal resources, social and active engagement all emerged as dominant themes across countries, but were articulated in subtly different ways in the participant countries. Positive perspectives, desirable attributes and satisfaction themes were intertwined within themes of acceptance and engagement. The current study provides a first step in the inclusion of geographic and cultural diversity into the SA literature. These results suggest that layperson conceptualizations of SA have broad-sweeping similarities, but further research is required to articulate the nuance of cultural influences on SA. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0,0,0,0
"s’s elderly population—a case study in learners of the senior citizens academy in a city of Taiwan. Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook site in 2004, and open to e-mail applications use in 2006. The global active users of the Facebook site surpassed one billion people on September 14th, 2012. It spent 13 years that the users of the Google site founded in 1998 surpassed one billion people in 2011. It spent 8 years that the Facebook site to do so. The official statistics of the Facebook site represented that there are about 15 million users visited the Facebook site monthly and there are about 12 million people visited the site by using the mobile Internet devices in the fourth quarter of 2013 in Taiwan. In the same time, there are about 11 million users visited the Facebook site daily and there are about 8.5 million people visited the site by using the mobile Internet devices in Taiwan. Taiwan is a mature market for the Facebook site, the website penetration is the highest in the world. Taiwan in where the Facebook site utility rate is so high faces the rapidly aging population issue. According to the statistics from Ministry of the Interior, Republic of China, the ratio of the population over 65 years old has exceeded 7% in 1993. It means that Taiwan is the aging society. The ratio of the population over 65 years old is 11.90% in October, 2014. With the statistics from Council for Economic Planning and Development in the Republic of China Executive Yuan, the ratio of Taiwan elderly population will exceed 14% in 2018, and Taiwan will be the aged society. The ratio of Taiwan elderly population will increase quickly from 2014 to 2025 because of the effect of the postwar baby boom. This investigation using action research discusses the elderly people studying IT lessons in the Senior Citizens Academy of a city in Taiwan. How do they use the Facebook site? We found that the elderly people is not the main usage group of the Facebook site, but using the Facebook site impacts positively for their learning, social networking, and the interactions among their family members. There are two difficulties for elderly people to use the Facebook site, one reason is they are not used to share their thinking to others, and the other reason is the computer operation is difficult for them. We also found that some of the elderly people begin to use the mobile Internet devices what are new things for them, and they use the internet, the Facebook site, Line by making use of the mobile Internet devices. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",1,0,0,0
"Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support. Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health. Contacting family is likely to be the best ""selling point"" of the Internet for older people.",1,1,1,1
"Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS. INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",0,0,0,1
"Attitudinal change in elderly citizens toward social robots: The role of personality traits and beliefs about robot functionality. Attitudes toward robots influence the tendency to accept or reject robotic devices. Thus it is important to investigate whether and how attitudes toward robots can change. In this pilot study we investigate attitudinal changes in elderly citizens toward a tele-operated robot in relation to three parameters: (i) the information provided about robot functionality, (ii) the number of encounters, (iii) personality type. Fourteen elderly residents at a rehabilitation center participated. Pre-encounter attitudes toward robots, anthropomorphic thinking, and personality were assessed. Thereafter the participants interacted with a tele-operated robot (Telenoid) during their lunch (c. 30 min.) for up to 3 days. Half of the participants were informed that the robot was tele-operated (IC) whilst the other half were naïve to its functioning (UC). Post-encounter assessments of attitudes toward robots and anthropomorphic thinking were undertaken to assess change. Attitudes toward robots were assessed with a new generic 35-items questionnaire (attitudes toward social robots scale: ASOR-5), offering a differentiated conceptualization of the conditions for social interaction. There was no significant difference between the IC and UC groups in attitude change toward robots though trends were observed. Personality was correlated with some tendencies for attitude changes; Extraversion correlated with positive attitude changes to intimate-personal relatedness with the robot (r = 0.619) and to psychological relatedness (r = 0.581) whilst Neuroticism correlated negatively (r = -0.582) with mental relatedness with the robot. The results tentatively suggest that neither information about functionality nor direct repeated encounters are pivotal in changing attitudes toward robots in elderly citizens. This may reflect a cognitive congruence bias where the robot is experienced in congruence with initial attitudes, or it may support action-based explanations of cognitive dissonance reductions, given that robots, unlike computers, are not yet perceived as action targets. Specific personality traits may be indicators of attitude change relating to specific domains of social interaction. Implications and future directions are discussed. © 2015 Damholdt, Nørskov, Yamazaki, Hakli, Vesterager Hansen, Vestergaard and Seibt.",1,1,1,0
"From Prototype Testing to Field Trials: The Implication of Senior Users in the Evaluation of a Social Application. This paper describes the approach adopted and the insights produced as part of the evaluation process of a multimodal social application dedicated to elderly people. The aim of the platform is to facilitate and enhance social interaction of people aged 60+, allowing them to keep in touch in a useful and easy-to-use way. As these kind of social-oriented technologies are by no way mandatory for maintaining an independent living at home, in order to ensure that they are accepted, adopted and actually used by elderly people, three complementary and intertwined issues are at stake: usability, usefulness and acceptability. In this paper, we describe how these three issues have been examined through the user-centred and mixed methodological approach that was adopted. We demonstrate that using both user tests in controlled lab environment and field trials at participants' homes has succeeded in producing relevant insights at each stage of the design process. We discuss how these insights have either allowed confirming the choices made, and thus proceed with development efficiently, or led to design ideas to improve the application. © 2015 The Authors.",1,1,1,0
"A mobile augmented reality assistive technology for the elderly. Modern technology offers many facilities, but elderly people are often unable to enjoy them fully because they feel discouraged or intimidated by modern devices, and thus become progressively isolated in a society where Internet communication and ICT knowledge are essential. In this paper we present a study performed during the Nacodeal Project, which aims to offer a technological solution that may improve elderly people's every day autonomy and life quality through the integration of ICTs. In order to achieve this goal, state-of-art Augmented Reality technology was developed along with carefully designed Internet services and interfaces for mobile devices. Such technology only requires the infrastructure which already exists in most residences and healthcare centres. We present the design of a prototypical system consisting of a tablet and a wearable AR system, and the evaluation of its impact on the social interaction of its users as well its acceptance and usability. This evaluation was performed, through focus groups and individual pilot tests, on 48 participants that included elderly people, caregivers and experts. Their feedback leads us to the conclusion that there are significant benefits to be gained and much interest among the elderly in assistive AR-based ICTs, particularly in relation to the communication and autonomy that they may provide.",1,0,0,0
"Mobile Instant Messaging for the Elderly. While the use of Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) has been expanding vastly along with mobile technology, existing MIM applications have not sufficiently addressed the needs of elderly users. MIM applications have great potential to support social interactions, and thus contribute to the well-being of the elderly. User interface design features such as small font size, confusing icons and application flow in current MIM applications, however, make them difficult for the elderly to learn and use. Our research aims to provide a usable and accessible MIM application for this user group. In this research, we combined user-centered and participatory action research principles. We conducted a focus group interview and user testing to identify the usability and accessibility issues in current MIM solutions, and collected requirements from elderly users. Based on the requirements and the principles for accessible design, we designed and developed a MIM prototype named Your IM to address the usability and accessibility issues faced by elderly when using MIM. © 2015 The Authors.",1,0,0,0
"Emotional social support and access to care among older people living with HIV in rural China. Objectives Globally, the number of older people living with HIV (PLH) is growing. Additionally, older PLH are facing particular challenges related to accessing health care. The objective of this study is to investigate the older PLH's access to care and its relationship to emotional and tangible social support. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 225 PLH who were 50 years of age or older in Anhui, China. A computer-assisted personal interview was used to collect the participants' demographic characteristics, perceived health status, and access to care. The following two dimensions of social support were measured: emotional support and tangible support. The association between emotional/tangible support and access to care was calculated using Pearson's/point-biserial correlations and with multiple linear regression. Results Higher tangible support was reported by the participants who were married or living with a partner, those who had higher annual income levels, and those with better perceived health status. Emotional support was correlated with higher education, higher income, and better perceived health status. Multiple regression analyses showed that access to care was significantly associated with emotional support (β = 0.2807, p < 0.0001) but not with tangible support (β = -0.0183, p = 0.7922). Conclusions The study findings point to the importance of providing emotional support for older PLH. It is suggested that emotional support should be provided for older PLH in addition to tangible assistance, in order to engage them in treatment and care. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

"Older people's perspectives on virtual mobility. This paper explores older people's perspectives on virtual mobility, adding to the growing body of literature examining mobility and independence in later life. Drawing on qualitative data from 20 semi-structured interviews with older people in the South of England, three key themes are discussed: (i) types of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) used in later life; (ii) motivations and barriers to using ICT in later life; and (iii) older people's perspectives on virtual mobility. Participants had differing experiences in terms of accessing and using ICT. Half of the participants regularly used ICT, whilst the remaining participants had either tried and did not get on with, or had never used ICT. Motivations for using ICT were cited as: keeping in touch with family and friends, particularly those at a distance; a fascination for technology; a source for information; and receiving such technology as a gift. Whilst barriers to using ICT were identified as: lack of desire; affordability; and a lack of knowledge, skills and confidence. Participants reflected on how they currently substitute or supplement physical with virtual journeys, and saw particular benefit in being mobile through virtual methods if they were to become permanently immobile in the future. The most common ways that the participants were virtually mobile was through their use of emails, online shopping, and video telephone calls. This paper suggests virtual mobility is a timely alternative to physical mobility that could help older people to remain independent and living in their own homes for longer. Therefore, the economic and social benefits, alongside the drawbacks of supplementing or substituting physical with virtual mobility must be considered in policies that support older people, and improve their well-being and social inclusion, both now and in the future.",1,0,0,0
"Design of a mobile social community platform for older Chinese people in Urban Areas. The increasing proportion of the older population and changes in the Chinese family structure make older Chinese people more vulnerable to social isolation than they previously were. This article illustrates the development of a mobile social application for older people in urban areas in China. The application facilitates the organization of leisure-time activities between older people with similar interests living in adjacent areas. Preliminary social requirements of older peoplewere collected through user interviews, and the major functions and features for the application were determined from the results of the interviews. Usability considerations for user interface design for older people were collected fromliterature and were integrated in the prototype of the mobile application. Older people's acceptance of the application was assessed by demonstrating the prototype to and interviewing 100 older people living in Beijing. The results highlight the critical impact of perceived benefits or relevancy on older people's adoption of new technology. Implications for the mobile social application for older Chinese people are discussed. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",1,0,0,0
"Who cares? Implications of care-giving and -receiving by HIV-infected or -affected older people on functional disability and emotional wellbeing. This paper examines how care-giving to adults and/or children and care-receiving is associated with the health and wellbeing of older people aged 50+ in rural South Africa. Data used are from a cross-sectional survey adapted from World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) conducted in 2009/10 in rural South Africa. Bivariate statistics and multivariate logistical regression were used to assess the relationship between care-giving and/or care-receiving with functional disability, quality of life or emotional wellbeing, and self-rated health status, adjusted for socio-demographic factors. Sixty-three per cent of 422 older people were care-givers to at least one young adult or child; 27 per cent of older people were care-givers due to HIV-related reasons in young adults; 84 per cent of participants were care-recipients mainly from adult children, grandchildren and spouse. In logistic regressions adjusting for sex, age, marital status, education, receipt of grants, household headship, household wealth and HIV status, care-giving was statistically significantly associated with good functional ability as measured by ability to perform activities of daily living. This relationship was stronger for older people providing care-giving to adults than to children. In contrast, care-givers were less likely to report good emotional wellbeing; again the relationship was stronger for care-givers to adults than children. Simultaneous care-giving and -receiving was likewise associated with good functional ability, but about a 47 per cent lower chance of good emotional wellbeing. Participants who were HIV-infected were more likely to be in better health but less likely to be receiving care than those who were HIV-affected. Our findings suggest a strong relationship between care-giving and poor emotional wellbeing via an economic or psychological stressor pathway. Interventions that improve older people's socio-economic circumstances and reduce financial hardship as well as those that provide social support would go some way towards mitigating this relationship.

Objectives The aim this study was to examine the effect of changes in physical and psychosocial working conditions on physical health functioning among ageing municipal employees. Methods Follow-up survey data were collected from midlife employees of the City of Helsinki, Finland, at three time points: wave 1 (2000–2002), wave 2 (2007), and wave 3 (2012). Changes in physical and psychosocial working conditions were assessed between waves 1 and 2. Physical health functioning was measured by the physical component summary (PCS) of the Short-Form 36 questionnaire at each of the three waves. In total, 2784 respondents (83% women) who remained employed over the follow-up were available for the analyses. Linear mixed-effect models were used to assess the associations and adjust for key covariates (age, gender, obesity, chronic diseases, and health behaviors). Results Repeated and increased exposure to adverse physical working conditions was associated with greater decline in physical health functioning over time. In contrast, decrease in exposures reduced the decline. Of the psychosocial working conditions, changes in job demands had no effects on physical health functioning. However, decreased job control was associated with greater decline and repeated high or increased job control reduced the decline in physical health functioning over time. Conclusions Adverse changes in physical working conditions and job control were associated with greater decline in physical health functioning over time, whereas favorable changes in these exposures reduced the decline. Preventing deterioration and promoting improvement of working conditions are likely to help maintain better physical health functioning among ageing employees. © 2015, Nordic Association of Occupational Safety and Health.

"Symptom severity, social supports, coping styles, and quality of life among individuals' diagnosed with Ménierè's disease. Objectives To (1) examine the quality of life of individuals with Ménierè's disease in relation to symptom severity, social supports, and coping styles and (2) develop a prediction model to identify factors most strongly associated with quality of life. Methods Data were collected using a web-based survey that included previously developed and validated measures (i.e. SF-12, Dizziness Handicap Inventory, Hearing Handicap Inventory for Elderly Screening Version, Iowa Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, Brief COPES, Lehman's Quality of Life). Ninety-five individuals with Ménierè's disease who were members of one of five online Ménierè's disease support groups responded to the survey. Results The findings indicated that symptom severity was negatively associated with patients' quality of life, social supports were positively associated with quality of life, and the use of negative coping styles (e.g. substance use, blaming) was negatively associated with quality of life. Four predictors (i.e. SF-12 mental health, dizziness severity, self-esteem support, and negative coping styles) accounted for 62% of the variance in quality of life. Discussion The findings suggest that the factors associated with the quality of life of patients with Ménierè's disease are similar to those reported in the literature among patients with other chronic illnesses. The results also suggested that emphasis on psychosocial factors may be an important aspect of a comprehensive treatment intervention for individuals with Ménierè's disease. © SAGE Publications.",0,0,0,1
"Perception of human activities: A means to support connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. This position paper describes a smart-phone based activity recognition system for improving social connectedness between caregivers and their elderly relatives. Sensing technologies can enable real-time monitoring to provide activity recognition in order to support health and safety among the elderly who are living independently. However, most existing activity recognition systems are focused on using sensors for unidirectional monitoring of emergency cases in particular, fall detection. Motivated by the desire to utilize bidirectional activity recognition to improve connectedness between an ageing population and their caregivers, we describe our planned approach to investigate how the perception of a caregiver's activities by a senior citizen and vice versa can aid in improving social connectedness. To investigate this perception, activity states will be transformed into an information visualization into the caregiver's home and vice versa without overt communication from participants. Findings are expected to provide further insight on the extent to which perception of human activities increase social connectedness.",1,0,0,0
"Developing radical-digital interventions to tackle loneliness amongst the elderly. Loneliness is a growing issue amongst older people and one popular approach to tackling it is by developing non-medical interventions such as befriending services, mentoring provisions, social clubs, etc. Our analysis reveals that these interventions are predominantly incremental-physical in nature and that there is a lack of radical-digital ones. In this paper we discuss the properties of digital technologies that can be potentially helpful for the elderly and we suggest that social innovation provides a robust theoretical framework to conceive radical-digital loneliness interventions. We also draw parallels between loneliness interventions based on social innovation and the emerging ‘sharing economy’ in the digital world and discuss the role of third paradigm of HCI research in this area. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",0,0,0,0
"Developing mobile application design of virtual pets for caring for the elderly. In the population ageing society, the companionship and care of the elderly, the medical system, and the consumer trend cannot be neglected. The contact with the external and the ones caring about oneself is essential for the elderly. This study aims to develop application with the functions of healthcare and accompanying, and the accessibility design is included in the interface, where virtual pets are the major communication media to assist the elderly in using mobile application. The required functions and contents in mobile application as well as the preference for the interface and models of interaction for the elderly are investigated in this study. It aims to ease and convince the elderly of the easy use. In the process of cultivating and training the virtual pet mobile application, the elderly could be accompanied and reduced the sense of loneliness; in the further use and interaction with virtual pet mobile application, the physical and metal conditions of the elderly could be real-time monitored and recorded to assist monitoring stations in managing the physical conditions of the elderly and nursing personnel in periodical checks. This research is preceded as following. First, literatures are reviewed. Second, Focus Group Interview is utilized for concluding the application contents and functions and the requirements and preference of the elderly for virtual pets. Third, an application experimental prototype is designed according to such requirements and preference. Fourth, the questionnaire, aiming to test the usability of the elderly, is filled. Fifth, the principles and suggestions for mobile application design suitable for the elderly are concluded based on the test results and analyses. The research outcome would assist in and contribute to the accessibility design of mobile application and the application to medical care by providing possible solutions for insufficient caring manpower in ageing societies and uneven distribution of medical resources. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",1,0,0,0
"ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial. Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

"Trauma in elderly people attended by a mobile emergency service. Introduction: The process of aging causes bio-psychosocial changes, that commonly, make the elderly more likely to be affected by chronic diseases and disorders due to external causes. Objective: Analize the occurrence of trauma and demographic characteristics of elderly people attended by a mobile emergency service. Method: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in the city of Sousa, in northeast region of Brazil, using data from 190 records of elderly victims of trauma attended by the MES from January 1St to December 31St of 2011. The Pearson's chi-square test (χ2) or Fisher's exact test with Freeman-Halton extension, were used to observe possible associations between variables. A significance level of α<5% was considered. Results: From the total of 190 elderly, 51.1% were male, aged between 60 and 104 years, mean age of 75.3 years (SD 10.44 years) and median of 74.0 years. Regarding the occurrence of trauma, 91.6% occurred in urban areas, 35.8% in the morning, 46.3% at weekend and 42.1% in the months from May to August. Falls stood out with 65.3% of cases and 87.9% had no alcohol on their breath during first-aid care. Among the injuries, wounds were predominant (62.3%) and 87.4% were referred to hospital. A significant association was observed between the presence of alcohol on the breath and sex (p<0.001) and age group (p=0.004) and between trauma mechanism and sex (p<0.001). Higher susceptibility was observed among males in the most advanced age group. Among the types of trauma, falls occurred mainly among women and traffic accidents among men. The presence of alcohol on the breath was verified especially among men and the majority of them were referred to hospitals. Conclusion: Knowledge of the characteristics of the demographics and occurrences of trauma in elderly people is necessary for the early identification of those individuals more exposed to this risk. Thus, it is considered that this research was relevant to characterize the elderly people requiring first-aid assistance and the occurrences of trauma, furthermore it is hoped that educational measures should be implemented in the community in order to prevent such traumas. © Under License of Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.",1,0,0,1
"Smart remote control design for seniors. Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users. Based on the data collected during the test phase we conclude that this product is useful and that it responds to a current need. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",1,0,0,0
"Global functioning of COPD patients with and without functional balance impairment: An exploratory analysis based on the ICF framework. Balance impairment is a common manifestation in older people with COPD and may contribute to overall functional decline; however, the relationship between balance and global functioning has not been studied. This study aimed to explore the global functioning of COPD patients with and without functional balance impairment. Functional balance was assessed with the Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test and global functioning with the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases. Participants (n = 134) were divided in 2 groups according to their performance in TUG (with and without balance impairment) and the ICF Core Set results were compared between groups. Fifty-four (40.3%) participants had functional balance impairment. The groups presented a similar extent of problems in several categories of the ICF components. However, participants with balance impairment were more severely affected (p < 0.05) in energy, pain, respiratory system, weight maintenance, exercise tolerance, neuromusculoskeletal and movement-related functions, and structure of head and neck. They also presented a significantly worse performance in handling psychological demands and activities related to mobility, self-care, domestic, community and social life, and a more negative perception of Environmental factors related to products and technology of buildings for private use and social support services (p < 0.05). Patients with functional balance impairment have more functional problems and are more severely restricted in daily life than patients without compromised balance. Understanding the relationship between balance control and global functioning will contribute to guide interventions aimed at maintaining functioning and minimizing disability. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",1,1,1,0
"Effects of adding an internet-based pain coping skills training protocol to a standardized education and exercise program for people with persistent hip pain (Hope trial): Randomized controlled trial protocol. Background. Persistent hip pain in older people is usually due to hip osteoarthritis (OA), a major cause of pain, disability, and psychological dysfunction. Objective. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether adding an Internet-based pain coping skills training (PCST) protocol to a standardized intervention of education followed by physical therapist-instructed home exercise leads to greater reductions in pain and improvements in function. Design. An assessor-, therapist-, and participant-blinded randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Setting. The study will be conducted in a community setting. Participants. The participants will be 142 people over 50 years of age with self-reported hip pain consistent with hip OA. Intervention. Participants will be randomly allocated to: (1) a control group receiving a 24-week standardized intervention comprising an 8-week Internet-based education package followed by 5 individual physical therapy exercise sessions plus home exercises (3 times weekly) or (2) a PCST group receiving an 8-week Internet-based PCST protocol in addition to the control intervention. Measurements. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and 8, 24, and 52 weeks, with the primary time point at 24 weeks. Primary outcomes are hip pain on walking and self-reported physical function. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality-of-life, participant-perceived treatment response, self-efficacy for pain management and function, pain coping attempts, pain catastrophizing, and physical activity. Measurements of adherence, adverse events, use of health services, and process measures will be collected at 24 and 52 weeks. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed at 52 weeks. Limitations. A self-reported diagnosis of persistent hip pain will be used. Conclusions. The findings will help determine whether adding an Internet-based PCST protocol to standardized education and physical therapist-instructed home exercise is more effective than education and exercise alone for persistent hip pain. This study has the potential to guide clinical practice toward innovative modes of psychosocial health care provision. © 2015 American Physical Therapy Association.",0,0,0,1
"An integrated approach to the well-being of the elderly people at home. The paper presents the outline and the preliminary developments of NINFA (iNtelligent Integrated Network For Aged people), a project for the well-being of the elderly people at home. This architecture is based on a service platform suited for elder people called the Virtual Village Network, whose user interface allows to deliver different services at home, namely: user supervision, communication and interaction among users for social inclusion, exergame delivering, monitoring of the wellness status. After the discussion of some results of the investigation on the acceptability issues of the ICT technologies related to the project, the User Interface (UI) and the novel Human Computer Interface (HCI) have been developed. The HCI is particularly suited for elderly people and motor impaired patients because the interaction is managed only by finger/hand gestures and by vocal control through simple commands. A set of preliminary exergames developed for the user training and monitoring are presented. During the exergame execution, the user interface allows the real-time acquisition of a set of motor, linguistic and cognitive parameters related to the user performance. The analysis of the verbal production of each subject is used to observe its language evolution and to detect the onset of any cognitive deficit. The relationship between some parameters and the neurological/wellness status of the user is discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",1,0,0,0
"Homelike Living for Elderly People: A Needs-Based Selection of Technological Solutions. Changes in global demographics have resulted in major consequences and implications in the economic, social, and political fields. These changes have created a growing market for aging-related technology. However, those who are responsible for purchasing solutions for the elderly do not always fully understand both the needs and limitations of the end user, and technological solutions are not usually developed from the perspective of the elderly in the first place. A technology review, in-depth and semi-structured interviews, and a questionnaire regarding the needs of the elderly and their views on technology were used to create the framework for technology selection. The emphasis is on comprehensive solutions and a move from single sales to public–private co-operation and collaboration. Technology is, however, not the answer to everything. It cannot replace human relationships, but suitable technological solutions can support a social life. © 2014 SAGE Publications",1,0,0,0
"Pervasive computing technologies to continuously assess Alzheimer's disease progression and intervention efficacy. Traditionally, assessment of functional and cognitive status of individuals with dementia occurs in brief clinic visits during which time clinicians extract a snapshot of recent changes in individuals' health. Conventionally, this is done using various clinical assessment tools applied at the point of care and relies on patients' and caregivers' ability to accurately recall daily activity and trends in personal health. These practices suffer from the infrequency and generally short durations of visits. Since 2004, researchers at the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology (ORCATECH) at the Oregon Health and Science University have been working on developing technologies to transform this model. ORCATECH researchers have developed a system of continuous in-home monitoring using pervasive computing technologies that make it possible to more accurately track activities and behaviors and measure relevant intra-individual changes. We have installed a system of strategically placed sensors in over 480 homes and have been collecting data for up to 8 years. Using this continuous in-home monitoring system, ORCATECH researchers have collected data on multiple behaviors such as gait and mobility, sleep and activity patterns, medication adherence, and computer use. Patterns of intra-individual variation detected in each of these areas are used to predict outcomes such as low mood, loneliness, and cognitive function. These methods have the potential to improve the quality of patient health data and in turn patient care especially related to cognitive decline. Furthermore, the continuous real-world nature of the data may improve the efficiency and ecological validity of clinical intervention studies. © 2015 Lyons, Austin, Seelye, Petersen, Yeargers, Riley, Sharma, Mattek, Wild, Dodge and Kaye.",0,0,0,0
"Elderly people in ehealth: Investigating internet self-efficacy and the role of occupational internet usage. EHealth initiatives are constantly evolving, supporting consumers to take active control of their health and well-being through access to health information and through communication with experts and peers via the internet. Although particularly elderly people could benefit from eHealth, they often feel unable to use the internet. Drawing on social cognitive theory, we seek to understand how internet self-efficacy affects the usage of eHealth among elderly people. As many elderly people nowadays are required to use the internet in their workplaces, we aim to explore the impact of prior occupational internet usage on self-efficacy. By conducting a representative study on 2,000 participants in the age of 55 to 75 in Germany, we seek to contribute to the knowledge on eHealth adoption and social inclusion of elderly people, as well as on prior occupational internet usage as a novel determinant of internet self-efficacy.",0,1,0,0
"Pedagogical practices to teacher education for gerontology education. This article discusses possible educational strategies for teaching cyberseniors in Distance Education. The objective of this study was to delineate pedagogical practices that can contribute to teacher training in gerontology education. This need resulted from the need to discuss the increasing longevity of the population. This change in society poses new challenges for education. In this sense, distance learning can become a way to social inclusion, because of its many possibilities. Unfortunately, there are a few related studies, especially considering didactic and pedagogical activity for teachers. Thus, we conducted a study using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. It is based on offering extension courses for the training of professionals and individuals 60 years or older. For data collection we conducted participant observation, interviews, questionnaires and survey of technological productions of participants in a virtual learning environment. From the reports of the participants it is possible to map strategies for teaching and teacher training, including professionals who work or intend to work in distance education with elderly adults. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",1,0,0,0
"A national survey on the decision-making process of dialysis initiation in elderly patients. Background: The decision-making process of dialysis initiation in the elderly involves different considerations compared with younger patients. Cognitive, functional and psychosocial issues are likely to be more important than standard prognostic factors. To assess the role of these issues in the decision-making process regarding dialysis initiation in the elderly, a survey was conducted among nephrologists in the Netherlands. Methods: An internet-based survey was sent to all members of the Netherlands Federation of Nephrology. Results: Out of 298 invited, 94 Dutch nephrologists responded to the questionnaire. Reaching consensus with the patient and relatives and early withdrawal are difficult issues in the decision-making process in elderly end-stage renal disease patients. Geriatric impairments were considered (very) relevant issues (varying from 7-10 on a scale from 1-10) in the context of dialysis initiation, with cognitive dysfunction being most relevant (median 10, range 6-10). The majority of nephrologists (56%) underlined the need for screening for geriatric problems when considering dialysis in the elderly. A total of 26% reported using some form of screening measurement for the determination of the presence of one or more geriatric impairments. Conclusions: Although cognitive, functional and psychosocial issues are considered relevant items in the context of dialysis initiation in the elderly, systematic assessment of these items is not standard of care in nephrology practice. Future research is needed to determine whether a more systematic screening for the presence of geriatric impairments can improve the decision-making process. © Van Zuiden Communications B.V.

"Characteristics associated with willingness to participate in a randomized controlled behavioral clinical trial using home-based personal computers and a webcam. Background: Trials aimed at preventing cognitive decline through cognitive stimulation among those with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment are of significant importance in delaying the onset of dementia and reducing dementia prevalence. One challenge in these prevention trials is sample recruitment bias. Those willing to volunteer for these trials could be socially active, in relatively good health, and have high educational levels and cognitive function. These participants' characteristics could reduce the generalizability of study results and, more importantly, mask trial effects. We developed a randomized controlled trial to examine whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation delivered through personal computers, a webcam and the internet would have a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. To examine the selectivity of samples, we conducted a mass mail-in survey distribution among community-dwelling older adults, assessing factors associated with a willingness to participate in the trial. Methods: Two thousand mail-in surveys were distributed to retirement communities in order to collect data on demographics, the nature and frequency of social activities, personal computer use and additional health-related variables, and interest in the prevention study. We also asked for their contact information if they were interested in being contacted as potential participants in the trial. Results: Of 1,102 surveys returned (55.1% response rate), 983 surveys had complete data for all the variables of interest. Among them, 309 showed interest in the study and provided their contact information (operationally defined as the committed with interest group), 74 provided contact information without interest in the study (committed without interest group), 66 showed interest, but provided no contact information (interest only group), and 534 showed no interest and provided no contact information (no interest group). Compared with the no interest group, the committed with interest group were more likely to be personal computer users (odds ratio (OR)=2.78), physically active (OR=1.03) and had higher levels of loneliness (OR=1.16). Conclusion: Increasing potential participants' familiarity with a personal computer and the internet before trial recruitment could increase participation rates and improve the generalizability of future studies of this type. © 2014 Dodge et al.",1,0,0,1
"Disordered eating among mid-age women: Is quality of life impacted over time?. Objective This longitudinal study of midlife women has three aims: examine quality of life (QoL) among women with and without indicators of disordered eating (DE); compare the obtained QoL effect to a younger cohort in the same longitudinal study and investigate potential moderating effects of depression and social support on the relationship between DE and QoL. Method We used self-report data from six waves of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women s Health over 14 years. A total of 12,338 women participating in the mid-age cohort (ageing from 45-50 to 59-64) provided self-report indications of DE at Surveys 1 and 2, and QoL (SF-36 component scales - mental [MCS] and physical [PCS]) at Surveys 2-6. Results DE was reported by 10.25% of the women who also reported significantly poorer mental and physical QoL than those without DE; this effect was sustained over 12 years. Effect size differences for the midlife and younger women, between those with and without DE, showed a larger impact on physical QoL over time for the mid-age women. Midlife women with high levels of depressive symptoms (with and without DE) had the lowest initial mental QoL scores. Midlife women with high depression and DE had the greatest increase in mental QoL over time, but their mean score was still considerably lower than all other groups. Conclusions This study underscores the significant effect of midlife DE on QoL, particularly when comorbid with depression, suggesting specific support options are needed for mid-age women. © 2014 Fairweather-Schmidt et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",0,0,0,1
"Silver surfers adopting and using Facebook? A quantitative study of Hertfordshire, UK applied to organizational and social change. With an ageing population that is on the increase, there are many older adults still in employment well past their retirement age. Currently, technological developments in the form of Online Social Networks (OSN. 11Throughout this paper 'OSN' is used to refer to Online Social Networks - in plural.) are also impacting society and organizations alike, with organizations searching for ways to cope with these changes. The aim of this research study is to investigate the factors affecting the likelihood of adoption and use of OSN within an older population. Using an online questionnaire, empirical data was drawn from Hertfordshire, a vicinity in the United Kingdom, and analysed using the Partial Least Squares method. The findings revealed that - in a household situation - older individuals adopt internet technologies if they have 'anytime access' to internet capable devices, a fast reliable internet connection, the support of their family and friends, as well as an apparent provision of privacy. For organizations, these findings indicate that the provision of a technical/trusted support department is essential, as is the provision for broadband and reliable internet connections. For academia, this research identifies factors that have been developed using theoretical concepts that will impact older adults' adoption and use of new technologies, but requires further research into whether these factors will impact a cross generation of workers in the organization. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",1,0,0,0
"Efficacy of a web-based, center-based or combined physical activity intervention among older adults. With more social support and environment-centered interventions being recommended in web-based interventions, this study examined the efficacy of three intervention conditions aimed at promoting physical activity (PA) in older adults. The efficacy analyses included the self-reported PA level, stage of change for PA and awareness about PA among participants. Eligible participants (N = 149; M = 65 years old, SD = 6), recruited in a unique Belgian French-speaking municipality, were randomized in four research arms for a 3-month intervention: (i) web-based; (ii) center-based; (iii) mixed (combination of web-and center-based); and (iv) control (no intervention). Web-based condition included a PA website and monthly tailored emails whereas center-based condition comprised 12 sessions (1 per week) of group exercising. With a significant increase in PA, the PA stage of change and the PA awareness at 12 months, the mixed intervention condition seemed to include the key social and motivating elements for sustainable behavior change. Center-based intervention was more likely to produce significant improvements of the PA level and the stage of change for PA change whereas web-based intervention was more likely to extend the awareness about PA. © 2015 The Author.

"Part-time versus full-time work: an empirical evidence-based case of nurses in Spain. Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the reasons given by nurses for working part-time; compare the work experiences, satisfactions, and psychological well-being of nursing staff working full-time vs part-time; and identify possible antecedents and sources of leverage to encourage part-time nurses to work full-time. Design/methodology/approach – An online survey was developed, pre-tested and validated, and sent to the regional associations of nurses in Spain for distribution to their members. Data collection involved a cross-sectional design. A total of 2,094 valid questionnaires were completed online. The majority of responding nurses were located in Catalunya and Gipuzkoa. Respondents were given 15 reasons and asked to indicate the extent to which each played a role in their decision to work part-time. Job context and job content scales bearing multi items reliable measures were also employed. All scales met the criteria of reliability. Findings – Nurses working full-time included more males, were older, had longer nursing experience (both job and unit tenure), reported higher levels of both job resources (autonomy, self-development opportunities), higher levels of positive work attitudes (job involvement, affective commitment, work engagement), more medication use, and a higher intention to quit. Full-time and part-time nursing staff were similar on marital status, levels of social support (supervisor, co-worker, spouse, and family), self-reported absenteeism, levels of burnout, levels of psychological well-being (psychosomatic symptoms, self-reported health), and potential accident propensity. Some of the more concrete results include: first, reasons for working part-time were varied with some being voluntary (going to school) and others involuntary (poor health). Second, different clusters of individuals likely exist (e.g. students, caretakers, transitioning to retirement or other career options). Third, part-time nursing staff tended to report a more negative workplace (less autonomy, fewer opportunities for self-development) and less favorable work attitudes (less engagement, job involvement, and affective commitment) than their full-time counterparts. Research limitations/implications – First, all data were collected using self-report questionnaires, raising the possibility of response set tendencies. Second, all data were collected at one point in time, making it difficult to determine cause-effect relationships. Third, although the sample was very large, it was not possible to determine its representativeness or a response rate given the data collection procedure employed. Fourth, the large sample size resulted in relatively small mean differences reaching levels of statistical significance. Fifth, many of the nurse and work/organizational outcomes were themselves significantly correlated inflating the number of statistically significant relationships reported. Finally, it is not clear to what extent the findings apply to Spain only. Practical implications – Health care organizations interested in encouraging and supporting part-time nursing staff to consider working full-time may have some sources of leverage. Part-time nursing staff indicated generally lower levels of commitment involvement and engagement compared to their full-time colleagues. Part-time nursing staff in this study reported lower levels of job resources, such as autonomy and self-development opportunities. Increasing nursing staff input into decision making, increasing levels of nursing staff empowerment, increasing supervisory development that in supporting and respecting the nursing staff contributions, reducing levels of workplace incivility, and improving nursing work team functioning would make the work experiences of part-time nursing staff more meaningful and satisfying. In addition, offering more flexible work schedules and tackling the stereotype associated with working only part-time would also address factors associated with working part-time. A more long-term strategy would involve enhancing both the psychological and physical health of nursing staff through the introduction of a corporate wellness initiative. Increasing the work ability of nursing staff by improving their psychological and physical well-being addresses a common factor in the part-time work decision. Social implications – There is a call in the paper for Spanish authorities to consider implementing the “Magnet hospital program” which is one model that has been shown to improve nurse and patient outcomes and is one solution to the shortage of hospital nurses in attracting them to work on a full-time basis. The process of Magnet recognition involves implementing 14 evidence-based standards. Originality/value – Experts claim that the part-time phenomenon is a growing trend and is there to stay. The authors still do not know sufficiently about the HR implications for having a large workforce of part-time employees. In this paper, a tentative attempt was made to better understand this phenomenon, especially when there is a shortage of qualified nurses in the health sector. Several promising research directions follow from this investigation. First, nurses working part-time need to be polled to identify factors that would encourage and support them should they desire to change to full-time work. Second, the authors learn more about the relatively low levels of involvement, commitment, and engagement of part-time nurses, a phenomenon that most organizations wish to minimize. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",0,0,0,1
"Psychological distress is associated with greater perceived disability and pain in patients presenting to a shoulder clinic. Background: Shoulder disorders are a common cause of disability and pain. The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a frequently employed and previously validated measure of shoulder pain and disability. Although the SPADI has high reliability and construct validity, greater differences between individual patients are often observed than would be expected on the basis of diagnosis and pathophysiology alone. This study aims to determine how psychological factors (namely depression, catastrophic thinking, and self-efficacy) affect pain and perceived disability in the shoulder. Methods: A cohort of 139 patients completed a sociodemographic survey and elements from the SPADI, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-2). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association of psychosocial factors, demographic characteristics, and specific diagnosis with shoulder pain and disability. Results: The SPADI score showed medium correlation with the PCS (r = 0.43; p < 0.001), PHQ-2 (r = 0.39; p < 0.001), and PSEQ (r = 20.45; p < 0.001). Current work status (F = 4.35; p = 0.006) and body mass index (r = 0.27; p = 0.002) were also associated with the SPADI score. In the multivariate analysis, greater catastrophic thinking (estimate, 0.003; p = 0.029), lower self-efficacy (estimate, 20.005; p = 0.001), higher body mass index (estimate, 0.006; p = 0.048), and being disabled (estimate, 0.15; p = 0.017) or retired (estimate, 0.16; p < 0.001) compared with being employed were associated with worse SPADI scores. The primary diagnosis did not have a significant relationship (p > 0.05) with the SPADI. Conclusions: Catastrophic thinking and decreased self-efficacy are associated with greater shoulder pain and disability. Our data support the notion that patient-To-patient variation in symptom intensity and magnitude of disability is more strongly related to psychological distress than to the specific shoulder diagnosis.

"Unobtrusive In-Home Detection of Time Spent Out-of-Home with Applications to Loneliness and Physical Activity. Loneliness is a common condition in elderly associated with severe health consequences including increased mortality, decreased cognitive function, and poor quality of life. Identifying and assisting lonely individuals is therefore increasingly important - especially in the home setting - as the very nature of loneliness often makes it difficult to detect by traditional methods. One critical component in assessing loneliness unobtrusively is to measure time spent out-of-home, as loneliness often presents with decreased physical activity, decreased motor functioning, and a decline in activities of daily living, all of which may cause decrease in the amount of time spent outside the home. Using passive and unobtrusive in-home sensing technologies, we have developed a methodology for detecting time spent out-of-home based on logistic regression. Our approach was both sensitive (0.939) and specific (0.975) in detecting time out-of-home across over 41 000 epochs of data collected from four subjects monitored for at least 30 days each in their own homes. In addition to linking time spent out-of-home to loneliness, (r = -0.44, p = 0.011) as measured by the UCLA Loneliness Index, we demonstrate its usefulness in other applications such as uncovering general behavioral patterns of elderly and exploring the link between time spent out-of-home and physical activity (r = 0.415, p = 0.031), as measured by the Berkman Social Disengagement Index. © 2013 IEEE.",1,1,1,0
"""Stay tuned"": The role of ICTs in elderly life. Ageing in western society has become a key issue in political and academic debate: politicians, sociologists, doctors, demographers, psychologists, economists are trying to understand how ageing will impact our future society. In this frame, media and communication technologies seem to be more and more relevant for the elderly, thanks to those services and devices helping people to grow old actively. Technologies, the Internet and ICTs could help the elderly to improve their quality of life, to be healthy and independent and to get better assistance. Our ongoing research investigates the relationship between the elderly and use of technologies, and explores the role played by media and ICTs in building a friendly and positive environment for the elderly, and in constructing and maintaining social relations and promoting healthy ageing. Specifically, the research will investigate the use of ICTs by the elderly by taking into account two different perspectives: a) Exchanges between generations: lengthening of life corresponds to a longer period of cohabitation between at least three generations (grandparents, children, grandchildren), and also of co-use of digital media. The research wants to investigate relations between two age groups (grandparents and grandchildren; young people and older people) to understand the dynamics of intergenerational mutuality in the use of technologies and ICTs. b) Media, ICTs, Health: the Western world is increasingly populated by elderly population. Technologies and ICTs can help elderly people to improve their quality of life, to be healthy and independent and to get better assistance. ICTs should encourage active ageing and, in the case of health technologies, new models of care. The project, lasting 1 year, is based on (1) a survey on young elderly (65-74 yrs) population in Italy, and (2) a field-work which consists of family interviews and ethnographical sections in natural contexts. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press.",1,0,0,0
"ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Study protocol for an international multicenter randomized controlled trial. Background: Falls are very common, especially in adults aged 65 years and older. Within the current international European Commission's Seventh Framework Program (FP7) project 'iStoppFalls' an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based system has been developed to regularly assess a person's risk of falling in their own home and to deliver an individual and tailored home-based exercise and education program for fall prevention. The primary aims of iStoppFalls are to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention program, and its effectiveness to improve balance, muscle strength and quality of life in older people. Methods/Design. This international, multicenter study is designed as a single-blinded, two-group randomized controlled trial. A total of 160 community-dwelling older people aged 65 years and older will be recruited in Germany (n = 60), Spain (n = 40), and Australia (n = 60) between November 2013 and May 2014. Participants in the intervention group will conduct a 16-week exercise program using the iStoppFalls system through their television set at home. Participants are encouraged to exercise for a total duration of 180 minutes per week. The training program consists of a variety of balance and strength exercises in the form of video games using exergame technology. Educational material about a healthy lifestyle will be provided to each participant. Final reassessments will be conducted after 16 weeks. The assessments include physical and cognitive tests as well as questionnaires assessing health, fear of falling, quality of life and psychosocial determinants. Falls will be followed up for six months by monthly falls calendars. Discussion. We hypothesize that the regular use of this newly developed ICT-based system for fall prevention at home is feasible for older people. By using the iStoppFalls sensor-based exercise program, older people are expected to improve in balance and strength outcomes. In addition, the exercise training may have a positive impact on quality of life by reducing the risk of falls. Taken together with expected cognitive improvements, the individual approach of the iStoppFalls program may provide an effective model for fall prevention in older people who prefer to exercise at home.

"Privacy perceptions of older adults when using social media technologies. Social media technologies represent an emerging means by which older adults can access health and community information, engage in peer-to-peer information sharing, and also potentially decrease social isolation. Privacy concerns, however, have been consistently identified as a barrier for older adults' use of the Web and social media technologies. The authors conduct a preliminary study involving 150 older adult participants, investigating their use and perceptions of social media technologies. The trial involved first providing the participants with brief training in three common social media technologies: Facebook, Twitter, and Skype. The authors carried out a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the participant's use and privacy perceptions of these technologies. Overall, the results are promising as to the potential to address privacy concerns to enable older adults to further utilize these technologies for improved mental, physical, and social health. Implications for future research and usage within the older adult community are also discussed. © 2015 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.",1,1,1,0
"Acceptance and attitudes toward a human-like socially assistive robot by older adults. Recent studies have shown that cognitive and social interventions are crucial to the overall health of older adults including their psychological, cognitive, and physical well-being. However, due to the rapidly growing elderly population of the world, the resources and people to provide these interventions is lacking. Our work focuses on the use of social robotic technologies to provide person-centered cognitive interventions. In this article, we investigate the acceptance and attitudes of older adults toward the human-like expressive socially assistive robot Brian 2.1 in order to determine if the robots human-like assistive and social characteristics would promote the use of the robot as a cognitive and social interaction tool to aid with activities of daily living. The results of a robot acceptance questionnaire administered during a robot demonstration session with a group of 46 elderly adults showed that the majority of the individuals had positive attitudes toward the socially assistive robot and its intended applications. © 2014 Copyright © 2014 RESNA.",1,0,0,0
"The ecare network in bologna: No longer home alone. This chapter describes the outcome of the creation of an eCare Network for frail elderly people in 2005. This was developed over the years as a network of citizens, associations, institutions, and professionals, providing a relational and support ecosystem to frail elderly people. The issue of financial sustainability of the health and social welfare system, in the phase of ongoing demographic revolution, has stimulated the creation of a service that aims to encourage the permanence of frail elderly citizens at home to prevent the onset of frailty or dependency and to improve their quality of life by fighting social isolation through the use of appropriate IT technologies. Community-based voluntary associations also play a key role in the eCare Network for the frail elderly. Starting for an evolving and always more challenging concept of frailty, the chapter describes the reality of the socio-geographical context of Bologna and the Emilia- Romagna region, together with the public as well as private organizational possibilities for intervention, which gave birth to the first experimentation of the eCare service. The chapter describes the gradual specialization and refinement of the service, and the parallel instruments used for better identification and take into charge all the aspects of frailty among the senior population. In the course of the chapter, a constant attention is paid to the necessary, and yet sometimes controversial, relationship between human help and technological aid. Finally, in addition to a detailed description of the activities that have been put in place, the service outcomes, innovations, and prospects for further development are illustrated. © 2014 by IGI Global.

"Frequent internet users may prefer more health care information and participation in decision-making. Objective: To determine whether there is a significant relationship between patients' frequency of Internet use and their health care information and decision-making preferences. Design: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Settings: Undergraduate classes at a large state university and senior-oriented computer classes at public libraries and senior centers. Subjects: 438 respondents, including 226 undergraduates (mean age 20) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72). Methods: Respondents were administered the Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ), a 21-item instrument designed to measure preferences for 7 types of health information and decision-making, in group settings. Main Results: The younger age group spent significantly more time online compared to the older age group. Frequent Internet users in both populations expressed an overall preference for more information regarding diagnosis, but less information for psychosocial and health care provider concerns. Internet use was positively correlated to the overall preference rating, leading the researchers to suggest that, as a whole, regular Internet users prefer more information and independence in decision-making. Conclusions: The study concludes that Internet use frequency is associated with an overall preference for obtaining health information and participating in decision making. Internet use as related to different types of preferences is inconsistent. Age was not found to be associated with the overall preference rating, and time spent online is proposed to be a stronger indicator of respondents' health information preferences. The authors suggest that future studies utilizing the HIWQ take a longitudinal approach in order to better track how patient preferences for information may evolve over time. © 2014 Newton Miller.",1,0,0,1
"Designing a facebook interface for senior users. The adoption of social networks by older adults has increased in recent years. However, many still cannot make use of social networks as these are simply not adapted to them. Through a series of direct observations, interviews, and focus groups, we identified recommendations for the design of social networks targeting seniors. Based on these, we developed a prototype for tablet devices, supporting sharing and viewing Facebook content. We then conducted a user study comparing our prototype with Facebook's native mobile application. We have found that Facebook's native application does not meet senior users concerns, like privacy and family focus, while our prototype, designed in accordance with the collected recommendations, supported relevant use cases in a usable and accessible manner. © 2014 Gonçalo Gomes et al.",1,0,0,0
"Bridging the gap between illiterate older adults and cognitive stimulation technologies through pervasive computing. The global ageing of the population has made the increase in age-related diseases more obvious, some of which are accompanied by a patient's cognitive decline (CD). That is a hard problem for Mexico, as a large number of older adults belong to marginalized sectors. These older adults are characterized by their illiteracy and limited financial resources, which make them more vulnerable to conditions such as the Alzheimer's disease. According to the literature, a person who participates often in cognitive stimulation (CS) activities reduces the risk of suffering a CD-related condition. This has provided the motivation to carry out case studies to understand older adults' interactions in CS sessions, and their relation with technologies and with members of their social family networks (SFN). To address these technological, social and illiteracy gaps, a pervasive CS collaborative system has been designed and evaluated which eases interaction through natural interfaces and enables SFN members to interact with older adults during their CS activities regardless of their physical location. The evaluation results provide evidence that participants perceived the system as useful, easy to use and providing a pleasurable user experience. Furthermore, these results show the feasibility of augmenting traditional board games (e.g. chess, checkers) to create pervasive CS collaborative applications and the importance and benefits of integrating SFN members as informal caregivers. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",1,0,0,0
"Improving Outcome of Psychosocial Treatments by Enhancing Memory and Learning. Mental disorders are prevalent and can lead to significant impairment. Some progress has been made toward establishing treatments; however, effect sizes are small to moderate, gains may not persist, and many patients derive no benefit. Our goal is to highlight the potential for empirically supported psychosocial treatments to be improved by incorporating insights from cognitive psychology and research on education. Our central question is: If it were possible to improve memory for the content of sessions of psychosocial treatments, would outcome substantially improve? We leverage insights from scientific knowledge on learning and memory to derive strategies for transdiagnostic and transtreatment cognitive support interventions. These strategies can be applied within and between sessions and to interventions delivered via computer, the Internet, and text message. Additional novel pathways to improving memory include improving sleep, engaging in exercise, and using imagery. Given that memory processes change across the lifespan, services to children and older adults may benefit from different types and amounts of cognitive support. © The Author(s) 2014.",0,0,0,0
"Acute stress impairs recall after interference in older people, but not in young people. Stress has been associated with negative changes observed during the aging process. However, very little research has been carried out on the role of age in acute stress effects on memory. We aimed to explore the role of age and sex in the relationship between hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) reactivity to psychosocial stress and short-term declarative memory performance. To do so, sixty-seven participants divided into two age groups (each group with a similar number of men and women) were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a control condition in a crossover design. Memory performance was assessed by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). As expected, worse memory performance was associated with age but more interestingly, the stressor impaired recall after interference only in the older group. In addition, this effect was negatively correlated with the alpha-amylase over cortisol ratio, which has recently been suggested as a good marker of stress system dysregulation. However, we failed to find sex differences in memory performance. These results show that age moderates stress-induced effects on declarative memory, and they point out the importance of studying both of the physiological systems involved in the stress response together. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",0,0,0,0
"White paper defining optimal palliative care in older people with dementia: A Delphi study and recommendations from the European Association for Palliative Care. Background: Dementia is a life-limiting disease without curative treatments. Patients and families may need palliative care specific to dementia. Aim: To define optimal palliative care in dementia. Methods: Five-round Delphi study. Based on literature, a core group of 12 experts from 6 countries drafted a set of core domains with salient recommendations for each domain. We invited 89 experts from 27 countries to evaluate these in a two-round online survey with feedback. Consensus was determined according to predefined criteria. The fourth round involved decisions by the core team, and the fifth involved input from the European Association for Palliative Care. Results: A total of 64 (72%) experts from 23 countries evaluated a set of 11 domains and 57 recommendations. There was immediate and full consensus on the following eight domains, including the recommendations: person-centred care, communication and shared decision-making; optimal treatment of symptoms and providing comfort (these two identified as central to care and research); setting care goals and advance planning; continuity of care; psychosocial and spiritual support; family care and involvement; education of the health care team; and societal and ethical issues. After revision, full consensus was additionally reached for prognostication and timely recognition of dying. Recommendations on nutrition and dehydration (avoiding overly aggressive, burdensome or futile treatment) and on dementia stages in relation to care goals (applicability of palliative care) achieved moderate consensus. Conclusion: We have provided the first definition of palliative care in dementia based on evidence and consensus, a framework to provide guidance for clinical practice, policy and research. © The Author(s) 2013.",0,0,0,1
"The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study. Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support. Further research into online peer support for carers of people with dementia is needed to clarify who benefits under what conditions.",0,1,0,1
"A wandering path tracking and fall detection system for people with dementia. This paper proposes a safety assistant, named wandering path tracking and fall detection system (PTFaD for short), which is a smartphone-based system monitoring people with dementia for both indoor and outdoor. The whole system comprises wandering path tracking and fall detection, safety-zone monitoring, communication services, alert notifications, and emergency medical services. To effectively track the elderly, the PTFaD uses a smartphone camera to take real-time pictures along the user's path as he or she moves about. Those photos, along with time and GPS signals, are delivered to and stored on the Cloud system. When there is a need, family caregivers can download those data to quickly find a way to help the elderly individual. Additionally, this study uses tri-axial accelerometers to examine falls. When a fall incident is detected, the alarm system issues notification messages to all emergency contact person in sequence until one responds to the system. If no one responds within a pre-determined time period, then the system immediately calls emergency medical services to procure timely help for that elderly individual. To assure individuals' data is safeguarded appropriately, an RSA method has been adopted by the system to encrypt stored data. The purpose is to guarantee that personal privacy is well protected. Any attempt at unauthorized access to the smartphone or Cloud will not succeed. Our reliable and minimally intrusive system provides people with dementia with an opportunity to maintain their social networks and to improve their quality of lives. © 2014 IEEE.",0,0,0,0
"Internet use and depression among retired older adults in the United States: A longitudinal analysis. Objectives. The purpose of this study is to examine the association between Internet use among retired older adults in the United States and changes in a commonly used predictor of depression (the CES-D). Method. Analyzing data from four waves (2002-2008) of the Health and Retirement Survey, we assess whether an available and commonly used index of a depression state was affected by prior values of the index and Internet use. The sample includes 3,075 respondents observed over 4 waves of data, yielding a total of 12,300 observations. We analyzed the effect on depression of Internet use and past depression in a full sample and a matched sample. We also conducted informal tests for confounders. Finally, we tested a basic mediation model to determine whether Internet use affected depression through its relationship with loneliness and social isolation. Results. Across methods, we found a positive contribution of Internet use to mental well-being of retired older adults in the United States, where Internet use reduced the probability of a depression state by one third. We found no evidence of confounding. Some evidence of mediation was found. Discussion. Our dynamic probit model indicates that for retired older adults in the United States, Internet use was found to reduce the probability of a depressed state by about 33%. Number of people in the household partially mediates this relationship, with the reduction in depression largest for people living alone. This provides some evidence that the mechanism linking Internet use to depression is the remediation of social isolation and loneliness. Encouraging older adults to use the Internet may help decrease isolation and depression. © The Author 2014.",1,0,0,1
"Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore. Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",1,0,0,1
"Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking. Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",0,1,0,1
"Cognitive impairment in depressed older adults: Implications for prognosis and treatment. Late-life depression is often accompanied by cognitive impairment. In some cases, the syndromes of depression and cognitive impairment may be related to the same underlying disorder (eg, vascular dementia, hypothyroidism), whereas in other cases, they may be relatively independent and simply coexist. Cognitive deficits in late-life depression span multiple domains; however, deficits in executive functions may be particularly important as their presence predicts poor clinical outcomes. Cognitive impairment, when mild, does not suggests the need for careful follow-up, particularly in cases where executive dysfunction is suspected. The Expert Consensus Guideline recommends antidepressant drug therapy combined with a psychosocial intervention as the treatment of choice for geriatric depression. New treatments including computerized cognitive remediation and problem-solving therapy may be particularly effective in treating both affective and cognitive symptoms.",0,0,0,0
"Understanding digital and material social communications for older adults. Online technologies are promising for helping older adults maintain social connectedness, particularly with younger people, yet many older adults resist or participate minimally in the mainstream technologies used by younger members of their social network. We present results from an interview study involving 22 older adults (age 71-92) to understand communication preferences and values related to social media. Seniors articulate many concerns with online social media, including the time required for legitimate participation, the loss of deeper communication, content irrelevance, and privacy. Additionally, older adults engage in social practices that could be supported by online social technologies, but they rarely use such tools. The theme of material social communications emerges from our data, and we examine this in context of online social media. We conclude with design considerations for the development of social media for older adults, and as part of this we describe the notion of bridging technologies as a framework for intergenerational communication design.",1,0,0,0
"A Mixed-Methods Randomized Controlled Trial of Financial Incentives and Peer Networks to Promote Walking Among Older Adults. Background. Financial incentives and peer networks could be delivered through eHealth technologies to encourage older adults to walk more. Methods. We conducted a 24-week randomized trial in which 92 older adults with a computer and Internet access received a pedometer, daily walking goals, and weekly feedback on goal achievement. Participants were randomized to weekly feedback only (Comparison), entry into a lottery with potential to earn up to $200 each week walking goals were met (Financial Incentive), linkage to four other participants through an online message board (Peer Network), or both interventions (Combined). Main outcomes were the proportion of days walking goals were met during the 16-week intervention and 8-week follow-up. We conducted a content analysis of messages posted by Peer Network and Combined arm participants. Results. During the 16-week intervention, there were no differences in the proportion of days walking goals were met in the Financial Incentive (39.7%; p = .78), Peer Network (24.9%; p = .08), and Combined (36.0%; p = .77) arms compared with the Comparison arm (36.0%). During 8 weeks of follow-up, the proportion of days walking goals were met was lower in the Peer Network arm (18.7%; p = .025) but not in the Financial Incentive (29.3%; p = .50) or Combined (24.8%; p = .37) arms, relative to the Comparison arm (34.5%). Messages posted by participants focused on barriers to walking and provision of social support. Conclusions. Financial incentives and peer networks delivered through eHealth technologies did not result in older adults walking more. © 2014, Society for Public Health Education. All rights reserved.",1,1,1,1
"Understanding the Impact of Face Mask Usage Through Epidemic Simulation of Large Social Networks. Evidence from the 2003 SARS epidemic and 2009 H1N1 pandemic shows that face masks can be an effective non-pharmaceutical intervention in minimizing the spread of airborne viruses. Recent studies have shown that using face masks is correlated to an individual's age and gender, where females and older adults aremore likely to wear a mask than males or youths. There are only a few studies quantifying the impact of using face masks to slow the spread of an epidemic at the population level, and even fewer studies that model their impact in a population where the use of face masks depends upon the age and gender of the population. We use a stateof- the-art agent-based simulation to model the use of face masks and quantify their impact on three levels of an influenza epidemic and compare different mitigation scenarios. These scenarios involve changing the demographics of mask usage, the adoption of mask usage in relation to a perceived threat level, and the combination of masks with other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand washing and social distancing. Our results shows that face masks alone have limited impact on the spread of influenza. However, when face masks are combined with other interventions such as hand sanitizer, they can be more effective.We also observe that monitoring social internet systems can be a useful technique to measure compliance.We conclude that educating the public on the effectiveness ofmasks to increase compliance can reduce morbidity and mortality. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",0,0,0,0
"Predictors of improvement following speed of processing training in middle-aged and older adults with hiv: A pilot study. Speed of processing training has been shown to improve cognitive functioning in normal older adults. A recent study demonstrated that middle-aged and older adults with HIV also improved on a measure of speed of processing and a measure of everyday functioning after such training. The primary objective was to examine what predicts the speed of processing training gains observed in the previous study. Participants were administered an extensive battery of demographic, psychosocial, and neuropsychological measures at baseline. They were randomized either to the speed of processing training group (n = 22) or to a no-contact control group (n = 24). Participants received approximately 10 hours of computerized speed of processing training. Predictors of training gains on the Useful Field of View (UFOV) Test and the Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (TIADL) Test were examined through correlational analyses. In general, those who performed worse on the UFOV and TIADL at baseline demonstrated significantly more training gains. Also, higher HIV viral load, poorer medication adherence, a higher number of years diagnosed with HIV, and lower baseline scores on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (an executive functioning measure) were correlated with better TIADL training gains. TIADL performance improved in those with higher HIV viral load, poorer medication adherence, and poor executive functioning. Speed of processing training may be a way to improve everyday functioning and therefore quality of life in more medically and cognitively vulnerable adults with HIV. © 2014 American Association of Neuroscience Nurses.",0,1,0,0
"Resocialization and metaphor of social networks: Co-construct with the user relevance of relational technologies. The subject of this publication focuses on the isolation problem. This can be considered a health and social problem since it has adverse health consequences to seniors. The objective of this research is to identify the relational patterns of the elderly in order to help recreate a network of relationships suited to their unique needs. The research method questions relationship dynamics, which include interactions with for example, alliances and desalliances, common points and affinities, meeting places including the use of social networks on the web. We study the new relational technologies around the notion of situation, described by Alex Mucchielli. The proposed work will rely on observation methods and interviews with isolated elderly. We want create a model of intervention which uses narrative methods for understand how the person built its social network. Copyright © IARIA, 2014.",0,0,0,0
"An ICT-mediated social network in support of successful ageing. Background: The idea is that an active lifestyle rich in social interactions and active engagement may mitigate age-related decline and reduce healthcare costs. The main aim of the AGNES project was to investigate the potential of new Information and Communication Technology (ICT) environments to help maintain the independence and wellbeing of elders. The innovative applications developed in this research project could have wide application for a large number of older adults living alone. Method: We used a web-based social network platform, enhanced with devices to detect users' states and collect activity data. The effectiveness of the ICT-based solution was assessed throughout the project with user and control groups in Spain, Sweden and Greece. User interviews and psychological testing were conducted at the beginning of the project and after a year of deployment of the equipment. Both groups completed the same assessment protocol. Results & discussion: We found that only the user group showed an improvement from pretest to posttest in the affective dimension of the wellbeing SPF-IL scale. This dimension relates to the degree of confidence, social acceptance, and level of satisfaction with the people around them. Exploring new ways to maintain the cognitive and functional state of older users is today a critical issue, for individuals, their families, and for whole societies. The study suggests the potential of AGNES to improve older adults' perceived wellbeing. However, more research may be needed to determine if AGNES is a tool to maintain mental health and independent living in older adults, especially those with MCI.",1,1,1,1
"Invisible connections: Investigating older people's emotions and social relations around objects. The advent of the Internet of Things creates an interest in how people might interrelate through and with networks of internet enabled objects. With an emphasis on fostering social connection and physical activity among older people, this preliminary study investigated objects that people over the age of 65 years viewed as significant to them. We conducted contextual interviews in people's homes about their significant objects in order to understand the role of the objects in their lives, the extent to which they fostered emotional and social connections and physical activity, and how they might be augmented through internet connection. Discussion of significant objects generated considerable emotion in the participants. We identified objects of comfort and routine, objects that exhibited status, those that fostered independence and connection, and those that symbolized relationships with loved ones. These findings lead us to consider implications for the design of interconnected objects.",1,0,0,0
"The PRISM clinical field trial to enhance well-being of older adults at risk for social isolation. Purpose: An increasingly important public health issue is ensuring that the growing population of older adults has the capacity to live independently and enjoy a good quality of life. Technology holds promise in terms of providing support to older people and enhancing their capacity to live independently. The objective of the PRISM trial is to gather rigorous evidence about the value of a technology application, the Personal Reminder Information and Social Management System (PRISM), which is designed for older adults to support social connectivity, memory, knowledge about topics, leisure activities, and access to resources. Method: The study design was a three-site randomized field trial. Following a baseline assessment, which included measures of demographics, health, prior technology experience, computer attitudes and proficiency, cognitive abilities, social support, and well-being, participants were randomly assigned to the PRISM condition or a Binder condition. Follow-up assessments occurred at 6 and 12 months post randomization. Participants also received a telephone interview at 18 months. Results & Discussion: Three hundred adults (aged 64-98 years) were randomized into the trial (150 participants in each condition). The sample is predominantly female, ethnically diverse, and from lower income strata. Although the majority of the sample population had minimal or no prior computer/internet experience, we were able to train all participants in the use of PRISM. The initial data indicate that the participants assigned to the PRISM condition enjoyed using the software and perceived it as valuable. They indicated that using PRISM facilitates their ability to connect or re-connect with family and friends, access community resources, and find information about topics of interest. The data also indicate that using PRISM resulted in re- duced feelings of social isolation and enhanced social support. Overall the data suggest that technology holds promise in terms of enhancing the well-being of older adults.",1,1,1,1
"Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults. Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",0,0,0,1
"Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking. In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",1,0,0,0
"Social networking-based personal home telehealth system: A pilot study. Background/Purpose: Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, yet expectations for the widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. The practical application of such systems are often found to be too complicated, too costly, and users, both older adults and professional caregivers, lack adequate motivation or experience to use the systems effectively. Methods: This paper describes a personal home telehealth system - Care Deliver Frame (CDF) - for older adults based on social networking, which transforms the home telehealth system into a platform for communication and care between older adults and their family members. The system is linked to existing social networking sites such as Facebook to encourage interpersonal communication between older adults and younger family members. The home telehealth system is implemented on personal mobile devices in the form of Apps. The scale and cost required for implementing the personal home telehealth system are greatly reduced. Results: From the pilot study of user evaluation, CDF was well accepted by the older participants and their children. Even though this evaluation is based upon a small sample size, it provides a good insight into participants ' behaviors, preferences, and expectations, which helps to determine the future development of CDF. Conclusion: CDF presented in this paper extends the value of a home telehealth system from the provision of health care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation.

"HealthTWITTER initiative: Design of a social networking service based tailored application for diabetes self-management. Objectives: Diabetes is a chronic disease of continuously increasing prevalence. It is a disease with risks of serious complications, thus warranting its long-term management. However, current health management and education programs for diabetes mainly consist of one-way communication, and systematic social support backup to solve diabetics' emotional problems is insufficient. Methods: According to individual behavioral changes based on the Transtheoretical Model, we designed a non-drug intervention, including exercise, and applied it to a mobile based application. For effective data sharing between patients and physicians, we adopted an SNS function for our application in order to offer a social support environment. Results: To induce continual and comprehensive care for diabetes, rigorous self-management is essential during the diabetic's life; this is possible through a collaborative patient-physician healthcare model. We designed and developed an SNS-based diabetes self-management mobile application that supports the use of social groups, which are present in three social GYM types. With simple testing of patients in their 20s and 30s, we were able to validate the usefulness of our application. Conclusions: Mobile gadget-based chronic disease symptom management and intervention has the merit that health management can be conducted anywhere and anytime in order to cope with increases in the demand for health and medical services that are occurring due to the aging of the population and to cope with the surge of national medical service costs. This patient-driven and SNS-based intervention program is expected to contribute to promoting the health management habits of diabetics, who need to constantly receive health guidance. © 2014 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.",1,1,1,1
"Using ambient communication and social networking technologies to reduce loneliness of elders. Online social networks have become part of our everyday lives. However, many elders do not use these networks even though social connections are important for their health and quality of life. To help elders feel more connected to their safety network we have developed an assistive solution based on the elders' requirements that aims at improving their communication and sense of presence. The prototype, consisting of a touch screen device and web services was evaluated in two field trials lasting for 28 weeks in total in Finland and in Austria. In addition to interviews, we used the logged usage data to analyze the user's experience with the system. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",1,1,1,0
"BeWell: Sensing sleep, physical activities and social interactions to promote wellbeing. Smartphone sensing and persuasive feedback design is enabling a new generation of wellbeing apps capable of automatically monitoring multiple aspects of physical and mental health. In this article, we present BeWell+ the next generation of the BeWell smartphone wellbeing app, which monitors user behavior along three health dimensions, namely sleep, physical activity, and social interaction. BeWell promotes improved behavioral patterns via feedback rendered as an ambient display on the smartphone's wallpaper. With BeWell+, we introduce new mechanisms to address key limitations of the original BeWell app; specifically, (1) community adaptive wellbeing feedback, which generalizes to diverse user communities (e.g.; elderly, children) by promoting better behavior yet remains realistic to the user's lifestyle; and, (2) wellbeing adaptive energy allocation, which prioritizes monitoring fidelity and feedback responsiveness on specific health dimensions (e.g.; sleep) where the user needs additional help. We evaluate BeWell+ with a 27 person, 19 day field trial. Our findings show that not only can BeWell+ operate successfully on consumer smartphones; but also users understand feedback and respond by taking steps towards leading healthier lifestyles. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0,1,0,0

"Online dating in middle and later life: Gendered expectations and experiences. Rising numbers of single middle-aged and older adults encouraged a proliferation of online dating websites targeting this population. However, few studies examine aging adults’ involvement in online dating. This study uses semistructured interviews with 18 online daters aged 53 to 74 and 2 romance coaches to examine how aspects of their online expectations and experiences are shaped by age and gender. Analyses reveal that men seek committed relationships, whereas women desire companionship without demanding caring roles. Different barriers to dating increase the appeal of online strategies: Men face narrow social networks, while women face competition from younger women and friendship norms limiting the pool of eligible partners. Both genders screen for youthful characteristics and attempt to convey youthful images of themselves. Men’s criteria center on physical attractiveness, whereas women’s focus is on abilities. In constructing profiles, women focus on their looks and sociability and men on their financial and occupational successes. © 2013 The Author(s).",0,0,0,0
"An analysis of the impact of cell phone use on depressive symptoms among Japanese elders. Background: There has been increasing interest in the impact of information and communication technologies, such as the computer and Internet, on physical and mental health status, but relatively little is known about the health effects of using cell phones.Objective: This study investigates how cell phone usage is associated with levels of depressive symptoms among Japanese men and women aged 65 years and older. We focus on social relationships, particularly intergenerational relationships between older parents and adult children, as a possible mediator in the association of cell phone use with late-life depressive symptoms. We therefore hypothesize that using cell phones contributes to the psychological well-being of older adults primarily through encouraging social relationships.Methods: We used 4 waves of data from the Nihon University Japanese Longitudinal Study of Aging (2001-2009) to analyze the impact of cell phone use on depressive symptoms. Results are based on ordinary least squares regression analyses.Results: Although the use of cell phones was related to lower levels of depressive symptoms among elderly Japanese people, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and physical health conditions wiped out the effects for men. In contrast, the protective effects of using cell phones persisted among women, even net of all controls. Moreover, the impact of using cell phones was not explained by filial relationship measures, suggesting that cell phone use influences the mental health of older women independently of social engagement.Conclusions: Among the many advantages brought about by recent technological developments, cell phones appear to be an important contributor to the psychological well-being of Japanese elders. Researchers and policy makers should prioritize access to new technologies for older adults. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.",1,0,0,1
"The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism. Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",0,0,0,1
"An Investigation of Later-Life Planning by Different Generations in Taiwan. The purpose of this study is to explore recognition of the importance of later-life planning and practice of later-life preparation by individuals from different generations. The study utilizes the Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) method, in combination with a later-life planning questionnaire, to investigate adults (over 20 years old) across 25 counties and cities in Taiwan. The research design employed proportional stratified random sampling, and it received 1071 valid samples. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, and logistic regression. Five findings stand out: First, later-life planning can be categorized into five domains: physical health, psychological adjustment, social relationships, financial management, and leisure life. Second, the subjects showed their recognition of the importance of later-life planning, especially with respect to physical health. Third, their preparations primarily took the form of following a balanced diet, maintaining a good mood, saving money, maintaining good relationships with family, and planning adequate leisure activities. Fourth, the results show intergenerational differences in recognition of the importance of later-life planning. Fifth, recognition of the importance of later-life planning effectively predicts one's practice of later-life preparation. Policy suggestions are offered for governmental and educational institutions dealing with older adults. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0,0,0,0
"PRISM measure development: The design and validation of the computer proficiency questionnaire. Purpose: Efficient and effective computer and internet training depends on an understanding of an older adult's existing level of proficiency. However, in the development of the PRISM trial (assessing whether a specialized computer system can improve the well-being of older adults at risk for isolation), we discovered that existing measures of computer proficiency are not suitable for people targeted by the PRISM trial who do not use computers. Measures were often designed for and validated with sample populations consisting of young adults or older adults who have ample computer experience. Existing measures also contained jargon, did not focus on computer activities predicted to be important for maintaining functional independence, and focused on experience rather than proficiency. As a result, we developed a new measure of proficiency and assessed its reliability and validity within our PRISM intervention sample and a sample of older adults who have computer experience. Subscale measures focused on measuring proficiency related to computer activities that are predicted to facilitate social support, communication, information access, prospective memory, and cognitive engagement. Here we present new data from the intervention, which further validate the Computer Proficiency Questionnaire (CPQ) measurements by demonstrating increased proficiency over time after PRISM computer training and exposure. Method: After pilot testing our new CPQ, we used baseline PRISM data (n=300) in addition to a sample of computer-proficient older adults (n=76) to demonstrate the reliability and validity of the CPQ1. We also measured CPQ scores over the course of a 12-month exposure to the PRISM computer system. Results & Discussion: We previously reported that the CPQ is a valid measure which correlates with both age and technology experience and, using discriminant analysis, can easily distinguish experienced and inexperienced computer users (>94% correct classification rate). The CPQ and each of its subscales were also found to be highly reliable (Cronbach's alpha=0.98, all CPQ subscales >0.86). To further demonstrate the validity of the CPQ, we examined changes in CPQ scores of older adults in the PRISM computer condition compared to participants in the non-computer control condition. After PRISM computer training and exposure, initial analyses indicated that PRISM participants demonstrated a significant increase in overall computer proficiency compared to the control condition as measured by the CPQ. Differential improvement in proficiency was also observed on each of the CPQ subscales. The ability of the CPQ to detect changes in proficiency as a function of training further establishes it as a valid measure, and significant changes in proficiency confirm the usefulness of the training developed for the PRISM computer system and the ease with which it can be mastered.",1,1,1,1
"The promise of gerontoludic design. Purpose: As Western society is rapidly aging, there has been a growing interest in the application of digital games to facilitate health benefits and to combat cognitive decline in later life. While research has indicated that playing digital games can produce many positive effects4, the academic literature on the study of digital gaming interventions for older adults often fails to adopt a holistic focus. The majority of studies on games and older adults explore either (i) potential cognitive or physical benefits1,2, or (ii) usability considerations5,6. While these lines of research are and should remain an integral part of the research agenda concerning games and older adults, an often overlooked third component is 'gerontoludic design' (i.e., the design of technology for older adults that strives for intrinsic motivation, engagement and enjoyment through a focus on meaningful play). Furthermore, as research3 indicates that functional limitations and severe disabilities are postponed by medical advances, a possible future beckons where the gerontoludic value of digital games is more important to its players than the potential benefits. Method: The argument for the importance of gerontoludic design in game-based interventions for older adults is first made theoretically through a multidisciplinary literature review, drawing from a variety of academic fields. Next, a design research study (n=10), a quantitative study (n=124), and a qualitative study (n=35) are analyzed. Results & Discussion: Through the analysis, key components of gerontoludic design were developed. The analysis identifies game design elements components that have been discussed for younger audiences as well, such as challenge, progression, flow, complexity, pacing, etc. However, the analysis revealed how certain groups of older adults have specific preferences for these game elements. For example, some respondents of the qualitative study discussed the importance of control over the speed of a game in order to accommodate them, or a preference for games that require the use of imagination while playing. The analysis also revealed components that have not been discussed for younger audiences, such as selfcultivation, connectedness to family, contribution to society, keeping pace with the times, nostalgia, and compensation. Based on this framework, a number of empirically supported design recommendations are presented.",1,0,0,1
"PRISM development: Iterative design using human factors tools. Purpose: We conducted a field trial to assess the relative benefits of: (i) a computer system referred to as PRISM (Personal Reminder Information and Social Management) versus (ii) a paper-based system containing comparable information (e.g., community information, educational resources, games). To evaluate the differential effects, we had to ensure that both systems were usable by and useful for the target users (i.e., older adults at risk for social isolation). In addition, the instructions for use and the training had to be clear and effective. To that end, we employed a human factors approach to the development of the PRISM system. Human factors practitioners investigate the capabilities and limitations of people and the demands placed on them when they interact with a system. Method: Our approach was multifaceted: (i) needs assessment with target users - we conducted a survey of older adults with computer experience to determine how they used a computer and the internet; (ii) we interviewed older adults who lack computer experience to assess their needs and interest in PRISM; (iii) we identified a prototype system to use as the starting point for PRISM and conducted a heuristic evaluation and cognitive walk-through by experts; (iv) we conducted detailed user testing of all experimental materials; and (v) we developed and tested a detailed instruction and support system. Results & Discussion: The survey and interviews yielded content ideas and challenges to be met in the design of the system. The evaluation by experts and target users identified user needs and design recommendations that were implemented in the redesign (e.g., meaningful icons and labels, navigation demands). The need for extensive training and instructional support became clear through the development and testing process, and thus these materials were integral to the implementation process. Overall, these data illustrate how human factors assessment tools provided valuable insights for design of the field trial, a necessary first step to ensure reliable and valid behavioral assessments.",1,0,0,1
"Maternal Authority Regarding Early Adolescents' Social Technology Use. Use of social technologies (e.g., cellular telephones, social networking sites) is highly prevalent among American adolescents, in some cases outpacing that of adults (Nielsen Company). Rapid cultural change such as that represented by technological advances comes with the potential to diminish elders' authority over youth. We analyzed qualitative interviews with 20 African American and European American mother-early adolescent dyads to consider ways in which mothers would-or would not-exert authority over adolescents' use of social technologies. Three distinct approaches emerged: abdication/loss of authority, conflicted authority, and retained authority. Mothers' use of these different approaches varied based on factors that included mothers' and adolescents' expertise regarding the technology being used, mothers' perceptions of risks associated with particular technologies, and mothers' and adolescents' beliefs and experiences with respect to social technology use. © The Author(s) 2012.",0,0,0,0
"A comparison of tablet computer and paper-based questionnaires in healthy aging research. Digital questionnaire delivery offers many advantages to investigators and participants alike; however, evidence supporting digital questionnaire delivery via touchscreen device in the older adult population is lacking. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the use of tablet computer-delivered and printed questionnaires as vehicles for the collection of psychosocial data from older adults to determine whether this digital platform would be readily adopted by the sample, and to identify whether tablet delivery influences the content of data received. Methods: The participants completed three questionnaires using both delivery methods, followed by a brief evaluation. Results: A nonparametric one-sample binomial test indicated a significantly greater proportion of individuals preferred the tablet-delivered questionnaires (z=4.96, SE 3.428, P<.001). Paired sample t tests and Wilcoxon sign-rank tests indicated that measures collected by each method were not significantly different (all P≥.273). Ease of use of the tablet interface and anxiety while completing the digital questionnaires were significantly correlated with preferences, (rs=.665, P<.001 and rs=.552, P<.001, respectively). Participants most frequently reported that the tablet delivery increased speed of use and improved data entry, although navigation was perceived as being more difficult. By comparison, participants felt that the paper packet was easier to read and navigate, but was slow and cumbersome, and they disliked the lack of dynamic features. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence suggesting that questionnaires delivered to older adults using contemporary tablet computers may be acceptable and do not substantively influence the content of the collected data.§",1,0,0,1
"Factor influencing the use of smart phone by Malaysian's elderly. The smart phone has become essential part of personal and business life across all age boundaries. The smart phone usage can potentially play a significant role in assisting the elderly in many ways especially in terms of maintaining social relationship, providing a sense of safety and accessibility. However, elderly seems to be the neglected user group in the design of recent smart phone interface and the penetration of the technology to the elderly are very low. Hence this paper attempt to report issues that are related to why this particular group of user aged 40 years old and above was influenced to own the smart phones and the data gathering was done specifically in Malaysia context. This research used an interview and survey instrument to obtain the data from the intended target group of user whom are using smart phones. The result indicates three main factors that influence the respondents to own their smart phone which is family encouragement, the use of mobile internet and social networking. © 2005 - 2014 JATIT & LLS.

"Commentary on PRISM. Purpose: This commentary reflects on and discusses a series of presentations reporting on the outcomes of the project that developed the Personal Reminder Information and Social Management (PRISM) system and to assess its effectiveness and usability. Overview of the Symposium Presentations The PRISM system was developed with the aim of maintaining the social connectivity and well-being of older adults. This symposium reports recent outcomes of a comprehensive research project on the development and evaluation of the PRISM system. The PRISM system was designed based on user-centered design principles, while using interdisciplinary collaboration that considered human factors and the opinions of psychologists and ICT engineers. The research team conducted intensive investigations related to user needs using surveys with and interviews of both project designers and potential users. The prototypes of the system as well as the related instructions were carefully tested with the help of potential users. The usefulness and usability of the system developed here was systematically evaluated by project designers using various methods with the help of a large number of potential users from diverse backgrounds. The project team has also developed a Computer Proficiency Questionnaire, a new measure of computer proficiency for appropriate evaluation of modern ICT such as PRISM. Overall, the research team has conducted the project systematically and comprehensively, while fully considering various human factors, resulting in successful system deployment. Perspectives Successful outcomes, reported in this symposium, illustrate the effectiveness of interdisciplinary collaboration of engineers, psychologists, and practitioners, as well as the advantages of a human-centered design approach. One of the significant points of the project was that the researchers have also focused on the affective aspects, such as whether the users enjoy using the system or their feelings of connectedness, as well as the functionality and usability of the ICT. This viewpoint should be considered as important in the development of technologies designed to increase the well-being of older adults1.",1,0,0,1
"Surviving Critical Illness: New Insights From Mixed-Methods Research. Current advanced medical technology allows survival of critical illness. However, the patient's psychological response to survival is relatively unexplored. Interviews with 32 older adult survivors, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Experience after Treatment in Intensive Care (ETIC-7) scale, Miller's Q-sort, and social work clinical wisdom, yielded unique and unexpected research results. Four response types were identified: avoiding, depressed, denial, and coping. Psychological agency during illness was found to be important. Participants did not reveal posttraumatic stress disorder-related phenomena predicted in previous literature but instead experienced posttraumatic growth. Hallucinatory experiences during illness were not traumatic, whereas social support emerged as a complicated concept. Participants unexpectedly revealed that childhood trauma was an important factor. Implications for clinical social work practice and research are outlined following the discussion of findings. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1,0,0,0
"Inferring health metrics from ambient smart home data. As the population ages, smart home technology and applications are expected to support older adults to age in place and reduce the associated economic and societal burden. This paper describes a study where the relationship between ambient sensors, permanently deployed as part of smart aware apartments, and clinically validated health questionnaires is investigated. 27 sets of ambient data were taken from a 28 day block from 13 participants all of whom were over 60 years old. Features derived from ambient sensor data were found to be significantly correlated to measures of anxiety, sleep quality, depression, loneliness, cognition, quality of life and independent living skills (IADL). Subsequently, linear discriminant analysis was shown to predict participants suffering from increased anxiety and loneliness with a high accuracy (≥70%). While the number of participants is small, this study reports that objective ambient features may be used to infer clinically validated health metrics. Such findings may be used to inform interventions for active and healthy ageing. © 2014 IEEE.",1,1,1,0

"An accessibility evaluation of social media websites for elder adults. Elder adults account for only a small portion of social networking site users despite the numerous benefits provided by social media. Although the number of elder users has grown in the past few years, many are not engaged with social media. Are there any special reasons for the elderly not to take advantage of social media? Are there any accessibility and usability challenges for the elderly to use social media? What are they? How do current social networking sites perform when it comes to accessibility for the elderly? This paper reports the preliminary findings to the above questions based on an instructor's notes on the discussions within an elderly computer class along with an accessibility evaluation of popular social media sites. The results show that many elders struggle with the understanding of Web 2.0 concepts and interpreting the complex layout of the social networking sites. Many sites do not adhere to respected accessibility standards and guidelines. Findings from this study will contribute to the understanding of the elder adults as a user group and improving the design of a more accessible website for the elderly. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",1,0,0,0
"Importance of gerontechnology use for elderly Turkish people. Purpose: Turkey's population is young, with only 6.6% of the population estimated at ages 65 years and older in 2013. However, the ageing population is growing rapidly, and Turkey is facing an aging population structure during the next decade. In this context, the majority of Turkey's elderly population will inevitably face significant health and social care needs in the future. Socio-economic and psychological issues such as loneliness, participation in society, maintaining quality of life and active aging, have become very important agendas with the increasingly elderly population. However, the formal and informal care workforce is insufficient. Moreover, a safe home environment will also be needed to provide access to health and social services such as assisted living facilities; this will enhance the quality of life and the participation of individuals in society. The need for technological devices that enable the elderly to provide for their own needs is very obvious. This paper describes a project using assisted living technology provided through local governments as well as by public and non-government organizations and also describes how to put this type of technology into practice. The purpose of the project is to address the challenges elderly people will confront and to meet the needs and demands of an aging population in Turkey. Method: In this study, we conducted face-to-face interviews with fifteen local government officials as well as with leaders of public and non-governmental organizations and managers who provide services in this project. Semi-structured interview techniques were used to analyze gerontechnological methods in Ankara, Antalya and I˙stanbul. We analyzed the perceived importance, acceptance, and difficulties in using gerontechnological products and services for older adults in Turkey. Results & Discussion: Gerontechnology is seen as a key solution for those who are faced with confronting the prospect of increasing demands for eldercare. The growing use of technology is facilitating access to health services in a way that enhances the quality of life for the elderly. Based on the results of this study, Turkish elderly people find gerontechnology readily acceptable, but social and economic access are crucial issues. The government must develop policies designed to provide affordable quality services, especially long-term care, for elderly people. Coordination and cooperation is needed between the various health and social care sectors. In conclusion, Turkey's population of elderly increasingly demand the use of technology. The elderly will benefit directly from technology but also face crucial challenges related to economic, social and cultural factors.",0,0,0,1
"A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly. Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",0,0,0,1
"Longitudinal patterns of problematic computer game use among adolescents and adults-a 2-year panel study. Aims: To investigate the longitudinal patterns (stability and change) of problematic computer game use and its interdependencies with psychosocial wellbeing in different age groups. Design: Three-wave, annual panel study using computer-assisted telephone surveys. Setting: Germany. Participants: A total of 112 adolescents aged between 14 and 18 years, 363 younger adults between 19-39 years and 427 adults aged 40years and older (overall n=902). Measurements: Problematic game use was measured with the Gaming Addiction Short Scale (GAS), which covers seven criteria including salience, withdrawal and conflict. Additionally, gaming behaviour and psychosocial wellbeing (social capital and support, life satisfaction and success) were measured in all three panel waves. Findings: The generally low GAS scores were very stable in yearly intervals [average autocorrelation across waves and age groups: r=0.74, confidence interval (CI)=0.71, 0.77]. Only nine respondents (1%, CI=0.5, 1.9) consistently exhibited symptoms of problematic game use across all waves, while no respondent could be classified consistently as being addicted according to the GAS criteria. Changes in problematic gaming were not related consistently to changes in psychosocial wellbeing, although some cross-lagged effects were statistically significant in younger and older adult groups. Conclusions: Within a 2-year time-frame, problematic use of computer games appears to be a less stable behaviour than reported previously and not related systematically to negative changes in the gamers' lives. © 2014 Society for the Study of Addiction.",0,0,0,1
"Stay Tuned': The Role of ICTs in Elderly Life. Ageing in western society has become a key issue in political and academic debate: politicians, sociologists, doctors, demographers, psychologists, economists are trying to understand how ageing will impact our future society. In this frame, media and communication technologies seem to be more and more relevant for the elderly, thanks to those services and devices helping people to grow old actively. Technologies, the Internet and ICTs could help the elderly to improve their quality of life, to be healthy and independent and to get better assistance. Our ongoing research investigates the relationship between the elderly and use of technologies, and explores the role played by media and ICTs in building a friendly and positive environment for the elderly, and in constructing and maintaining social relations and promoting healthy ageing. Specifically, the research will investigate the use of ICTs by the elderly by taking into account two different perspectives: a) Exchanges between generations: lengthening of life corresponds to a longer period of cohabitation between at least three generations (grandparents, children, grandchildren), and also of co-use of digital media. The research wants to investigate relations between two age groups (grandparents and grandchildren; young people and older people) to understand the dynamics of intergenerational mutuality in the use of technologies and ICTs. b) Media, ICTs, Health: the Western world is increasingly populated by elderly population. Technologies and ICTs can help elderly people to improve their quality of life, to be healthy and independent and to get better assistance. ICTs should encourage active ageing and, in the case of health technologies, new models of care. The project, lasting 1 year, is based on (1) a survey on young elderly (65-74 yrs) population in Italy, and (2) a field-work which consists of family interviews and ethnographical sections in natural contexts. © 2014 The authors and IOS Press.",1,0,0,0
"Quality of life and retirement preparation of school teachers in chon buri province. The objectives of this research were to investigate: (1) the quality of life of school teachers in Chon Buri province; (2) the retirement preparation of school teachers in Chon Buri province; and (3) the relationship between the quality of life and retirement preparation of school teachers in Chon Buri province. A questionnaire was employed to gather data from 325 school teachers who were over 50 years old, and had been selected by multi-stage random sampling. Data were analyzed to acquire percentage, mean, Pearson product moment correlation coefficient and stepwise multiple regression statistics using a computer program. The findings revealed that most of the school teachers were female with an average age of 52.69 years old, earned 33,794.34 baht monthly and nearly three fifths gave a high priority to retirement preparation. The results showed that half of the school teachers assumed a moderate level of quality of life. When considering each aspect, it was found that their quality of life concerning physical, psychological, environmental, and social relationship aspects were at a good level. The findings revealed that two thirds of them rated their retirement preparation at a good level. Regarding retirement preparation aspects, the school teachers indicated that their retirement preparation concerning physical, psychological, habitation, and property aspects were at a good level whereas the leisure-time activities aspect was at a moderate level. Pearson product moment correlation coefficient analysis showed that the quality of life and retirement preparation were positively correlated and statistically significant at the .01 level. The stepwise multiple regression indicated that physical and psychological preparation for retirement were two aspects positively related to and influenced by the quality of life of school teachers, statistically significant at the .01 level. © 2014 Kasetsart J.

"Online high-quality topic detection for bulletin board systems. Even with the recent development of new types of social networking services such as microblogs, Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) remains popular for local communities and vertical discussions. These BBS sites have high volume of traffic everyday with user discussions on a variety of topics. Therefore it is difficult for BBS visitors to find the posts that they are interested in from the large amount of discussion threads. We attempt to explore several main characteristics of BBS, including organizational flexibility of BBS texts, high data volume and aging characteristic of BBS topics. Based on these characteristics, we propose a novel method of Online Topic Detection (OTD) on BBS, which mainly includes a representative post selection procedure based on Markov chain model and an efficient topic clustering algorithm with candidate topic set generation based on Aging Theory. Experimental results show that our method improves the performance of OTD in BBS environment in both detection accuracy and time efficiency. In addition, analysis on the aging characteristic of discussion topics shows that the generation and aging of topics on BBS is very fast, so it is wise to introduce candidate topic set generation strategy based on Aging Theory into the topic clustering algorithm.

"Psychosocial aspects on the use of technology by older people: A comparative study of the United Kingdom and Brazil. Purpose: Older people perceive themselves as uncomfortable in using technology and also lack confidence in their abilities both learn and manage these systems effectively1. The related aspects of difficulty with use include specifics that evolve as older people age and experience bodily changes from the aging process. These specific factors include levels of education, gender, previous contact and experience with technologies, and access. Other factors include things such as lack of confidence in ability and motivation, concerns related to information security, attitudes towards use, changes in cognitive skills involving memory, information processing speed, attention span, decisionmaking abilities, and crystallized intelligence. These factors are based on models of acceptance and recognition of the usefulness and ease of use of using technology2. This study aims to describe the perception of the elderly on the use of technology in everyday life, by focusing on the psychosocial and family related aspects of the use of technology by older adults. Method: This is an exploratory, cross-sectional, descriptive study involving 100 adults and elderly subjects, 50 Brazilian and 46 British adults and four respondents from abroad who have been living in the UK for more than ten years. For convenience, the sample included 30 males and 70 females (16 males/34 females in The UK and 14 males/36 females in Brazil). These participants were active, educated subjects with about 15 years of formal education and older than 50 (British sample mean age of 66.1, Brazilian sample mean age of 67, overall median of 66.9 years) from different social-economic classes who presented with preserved functional capacity for instrumental daily-living activities (IDLA) and no cognitive impairment. The procedures for data collection included a social-economic questionnaire, an IDLA index, the Lawton & Brody scale3, and a self-reported, structured questionnaire with closed and semi-closed questions on the perception of the use of electronic devices. Results & Discussion: Various respondents feel task-dependence and the difficulty in using electronic devices causes them to depend on other people. This dependence is reported by 69.2% and 62.9% of the British and Brazilian subjects, respectively. However, the Brazilians report that they feel more embarrassed, pressured and nervous when they need to use certain electronic devices in public compared to the British elderly; these feelings also result in a self-perception of incompetence and inability regarding the use of new technologies. Exposure time to technology had a positive impact during the most advanced phases of use, which was supported by reports of fewer difficulties in the use of such devices, a feeling of greater confidence, and a sense of belonging to the modern world-aspects mainly reported by British subjects. The frequency of use of electronic devices in daily life, the ability to use them, use perception in public, resulting in a stressful experience were shown to be the main differences between the British and Brazilian groups. Brazilians started using computers and mobiles more recently than the English group. 30% of the British sample reported that they have begun to use computers, 30% cell phones, 22% tablets, and 14% e-readers (e.g. Kindle, Kobo). In the Brazilian sample, 48% had begun using computers, 62% cell phones, 6% tablets, and 2% e-readers, within the past 12 months. Both recognized that new technologies facilitate contact, had difficulty using these devices and felt dependent on others. Both were not comfortable in modern society, they complained that such appliances were unsuitable to their tastes and they felt a lack of contact as a result of failing to use these devices in the past.",1,0,0,1
"Transform silver elderly to gold resources. Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",1,0,0,1
"A descriptive analysis of relationship between extraversion-introversion and behavior and lifestyle patterns among ngineering students in India. The present study focuses on a descriptive statistical analysis of the relationship between extraversion and introversion tendencies and various factors that can affect extraversion-introversion among engineering students in India.

"Prescribing physical activity for healthy aging: Longitudinal follow-up and mixed method analysis of a primary care intervention. Background: There is a shortage of literature describing the experience of individuals who have participated in a physical activity and mobile health (mHealth) intervention. Many physical activity interventions are of short duration and do not report long-term changes in clinical measures or adoption of prescribed health behaviors. Previously, we have reported the clinical and behavioral outcomes from the first phase of a physical activity prescription and mHealth intervention delivered through the primary care setting. The purpose of this next phase is to perform a longitudinal follow-up 6-months postintervention. Methods: Mixed methods analysis including repeated measures ANOVA of functional aerobic capacity (VO2max) at preintervention, postintervention, and follow-up clinic visits, and whole text analysis of semistructured interviews discussing the participant experience in a health behavior intervention. Results: Twenty participants, mean age 63 ± 5 years, participated. Gains made in VO2max were maintained at 6 months (P &lt; 0.05). Participants reported engaging in sustained and routine physical activity, yet some identified a need for additional support to adopt the prescribed health behaviors. Emergent themes included the desire for short-term mHealth intervention to educate individuals about prescribed health behaviors without need for ongoing management by clinicians, leveraging mHealth to build social networks around prescribed health behaviors and to connect individuals to build a sense of community, and participant views of physical activity as medicine. Conclusions: The present study investigated both the long-term adoption of physical activity behaviors as well as the participant experience in a physical activity and mHealth intervention. Findings from the current study may be used to inform the development of user-centered lifestyle interventions. © The Physician and Sportsmedicine.",1,1,1,1
"Situating communication devices in tribal communities to enhance convenience in daily life by facilitating tribal community building. Purpose: The Living Lab concept of a collaborative setup for users to shape technology and its applications can generate new understandings of future business opportunities1. However, implementing Living Lab concepts requires a very open approach that sometimes contradicts a company's specific business model. Our project uses the concept of Living Labs to create a systematic and participatory approach to providing health care and strengthening community ties in tribal areas. This is, in fact, a regional planning project. Its open innovation platform incorporates three core functions: putting an IT platform for healthcare management in place, providing medical devices for home care through existing eldercare services, and situating communication devices to make daily life more convenient and facilitate tribal community building2-4. Method: We are establishing an experimental field for smart technologies designed to assist indigenous elderly in Nan-ao Township in cooperation with Saint Mary's Hospital Luodong, the Health Bureau of Yilan County, leading tele-care companies, the health care device industry, tribal leaders and community health networks. A university-based community partnership serves as a mediator, reducing health gaps in the region. Empowerment and user-driven innovation are key concepts to develop new service and business models. Research team members, working with tribal device users, design ICT products through a mutually supportive, participatory approach. At the same time, an innovative, foundational platform for promoting community health will be established by all stake holders in this indigenous tribe5. Eight community leaders and around 30 residents have taken part in this project. Results & Discussion: We designed a Living Lab with an e-learning platform to link social networking activity, detailed oral history data archives, and health promotion/rehabilitation activities with health data collections. The data collections were organized through health-related activities, coordinated mainly by the research team and the tribal association leaders. In this system, the community becomes a basic unit for developing self-sustained business and distributing neighborhood health information. Such neighborhoods may turn out to be both mobilization units and Living Labs for gathering data on local culture and eco-region planning.",1,0,0,1
"Technology as system innovation: A key informant interview study of the application of the diffusion of innovation model to telecare. Purpose: To identify and explore factors that influence adoption, implementation and continued use of telecare technologies. Method: As part of the Assistive Technologies for Healthy Living in Elders: Needs Assessment by Ethnography (ATHENE) project, 16 semi-structured interviews were conducted with key participants from organisations involved in developing and providing telecare technologies and services. Data were analysed thematically, using a conceptual model of diffusion of innovations. Results: Participants identified numerous interacting factors that facilitated or hindered adoption and use. As predicted by the model, these related variously to the technology, individual adopters, the process of social influence, the innovativeness and readiness of organisations, implementation and routinisation processes following initial adoption, and the nature and strength of linkages between these elements. Key issues included (i) the complexity and uniqueness of the ""user system"", (ii) the ongoing work needed to support telecare use beyond initial adoption, and (iii) the relatively weak links that typically exist between users of telecare technologies and the organisations who design and distribute them. Conclusions: Telecare is not merely a technology but a complex innovation requiring input from, and coordination between, people and organisations. To promote adoption and use, these contextual factors must be specified, understood and addressed.Implications for RehabilitationTelecare should not be thought of as a ""plug and play"" technology but as a complex innovation requiring input from, and coordination between, people and organisations.To promote adoption and use of telecare, a number of contextual factors must be specified, understood and addressed.End users and other stakeholders should be linked at the earliest stages of design and development. Such co-production should aim to identify how technologies might better fit with users' material surroundings, social networks and desired lifestyles, rather than being technology-driven and focused on proof of concept or usability. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.",0,0,0,1
"Fear and the use of technological devices by older people. Purpose: This study investigates the presence of fear related to the use of technology by a group of Brazilian elderly people. Studies suggest that older people may feel anxiety regarding the use of technology (computer anxiety), which is defined as emotional fear, apprehension and phobia felt by individuals related to interacting with computers or when thinking of working with a computer1-3. Method: This is a transversal, qualitative-quantitative and analytical study. The sample of participants was already defined. Data was collected at public and private locations in the city of Olimpia, in the state of Sao Paulo (i.e. a community center for the elderly and a club for elderly practicing sports) and in Ribeirao Preto City, Sao Paulo, where data collection was performed at the Digital Inclusion Project for Elderly (PIDI). Subjects were recruited by the researcher, through visits to the places mentioned above and by formal invitation to individuals to participate in the study. The data collection was done using a socioeconomic questionnaire, the scale of acceptance of technologies and a questionnaire about the factors that affect the use of electronic devices. The last two questionnaires had questions relating to the fear of using technology. At the PIDI, subjects were interviewed at the beginning of the course, so that there was no influence from the contact with the technologies and lessons on the feelings of fear on the participants. Descriptive statistics were used as the method of data analysis. Results & Discussion: The study included 100 older people aged between the ages of 60 and 86 years with a mean age of 69.38 years. Of the participants, 78% were female, 44% married, 59% had completed high school, and 86% were not economically active (retired or housewives). Of the elderly respondents, 24% reported being afraid to use new technological devices and 43.4% reported fear related to damaging the devices. The elderly responded that they feel afraid when using the internet; they fear viruses, social networks and spoiling or breaking the device. They are also afraid of ATMs, computers, new things, making mistakes and the consequences of these mistakes, such as deleting other people's documents on the computer, not being able to learn how to use a computer and being unable to use the device. They reported being afraid because of previous bad experiences with technology. The subjects stated that the complexity of the devices makes them difficult to use. The many features available on devices mean that people cannot understand the precise operation of the device. Also, the cost of maintaining the electronics eventually leaves them afraid that something will happen to the device. Older people who reported feeling apprehensive about damaging the device reported that they use excessive care when using the device. They think the devices should be simpler and also reported feeling apprehension about causing damage and not being able to get anyone to help fix any errors. Despite these difficulties, the elderly reported that they could overcome their fears after attending courses related to the inclusion of the elderly in the world; they are curious about technological advances. The results indicated that the considerable advancements in technology bring benefits, whether these advancements are inherent to the devices or to the individuals concerned, regardless of the barriers faced. Some of the barriers reported in the responses of the subjects included design, multiple functions, lack of security, and cognitive deficits. From the older people's responses, it is possible to note that fear has a significant influence on the attitudes of elderly people in relation to technological devices that can result in a lack of use or in a search for solutions to mitigate their fears and difficulties, such as seeking digital inclusion programs. Therefore, more research on variables such as the fear that may influence the use of new technology is needed, and strategies should be created to allow the elderly to better handle the obstacles that prevent the use of these devices.",1,0,0,1
"Future housing and support needs of people with dementia. In an ageing society such as Australia, there is growing recognition of the importance of planning for the future care of older people with dementia (PwD). Dementia is predicted to become the leading cause of disability by 2016, with the number of cases in Australia expected to increase to close to 1 million by 2050 (AIHW 2007, p.52). While there is a growing literature around managing dementia, to date, insight into the role of housing in supporting PwD and the planning and coordination of health and housing services has been limited. This project on the Future housing and support needs of people with dementia aims to address this gap. In Chapter 1, we provide an introduction to the project and the report. This includes an outline of: the research and policy significance of the project; the major themes and questions that frame the research; and the structure of the Positioning Paper. In Chapter 2, we examine recent international and national research on dementia and housing. Key findings emerging from this review include: Housing is recognised as a critical protective factor in relation to the health and well-being of older Australians. Older Australians have articulated a desire to retain independence and they support a consumer-directed approach to health care. A substantial proportion of PwD live in the community, an estimated 70 per cent of all PwD, and this is expected to grow over the coming decades. A PwD's home is critical to their quality of life, with PwD more likely than others in the community to be spending a significant proportion of their time in the home. Continuing to live in their family home and share their lives with loved ones is of primary significance in enabling PwD to cope with the challenges of loss of memory function. One of the major advantages of PwD remaining in their own home following diagnosis is that the home is a familiar environment. For PwD, remaining in their own home holds distinct advantages during the mild and moderate stages of the condition, but this situation changes as the condition progresses. Co-resident caregivers become a critical companion in supporting PwD to continue to undertake tasks they are competent in and assisting with tasks when the PwD experiences a loss in capacity. PwD who live alone are at risk of social isolation, self-neglect, self-injury, depression, and exploitation by others. PwD are more likely to be female and to have lower incomes and they are less likely to access services and support. There are a range of design interventions and assistive technologies that can make a difference to the well-being of PwD and allow them to continue to mobilise remaining strengths and capacities. Home modifications are effective in decreasing the incidence of accidents and injury, and they can strengthen home-based social relationships and networks and reduce strain on caregivers. PwD are more likely to remain in place if supported by live-in carers, but carers' own pressing needs for appropriate housing are less often addressed, particularly those on low incomes. The impact of an ageing population on the housing sector is substantial, with older households projected to grow from 1.6 to 3.2 million between 2008 and 2028. An AHURI study of older persons in public housing (2008) found that housing authority staff felt that they were not well-equipped to assist tenants with dementia and that they have little knowledge of, and limited relationships with, community aged care services. The establishment of a National Indigenous Dementia Strategy reflects growing awareness of dementia as a public health concern in Indigenous communities and the need for a coordinated, partnership approach between Indigenous communities, governments, health networks and the research community in responding to community need. The role of housing is not well understood in relation to cognitive decline and dementia in Indigenous communities. However, it is recognised that poor living conditions and poor quality housing exacerbate problems for Indigenous people in remote areas with dementia. PwD, as their condition advances, will typically transition into residential care. The literature identifies three consistent predictors of entry into residential care: dementia severity and cognitive decline; behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia; and caregivers' health and burden. Studies of transitions into residential care highlight the importance of participation by both PwD and their carers in the decision to enter into residential care. Service-integrated housing in Australia is experiencing moderate growth, primarily within the community and private sector. More research and policy development is required to ensure that this form of housing provision can support a diverse aged population. In Chapter 3, we examine available secondary data on the housing circumstances of older Australians and PwD. Key findings emerging from this review of secondary data sources relating to PwD include: There are 266 574 PwD in Australia in 2011. This is projected to increase to 553 285 people by 2030 and 942 624 by 2050. Dementia rates are relatively low until the age of 70 years and then incidence rates increase rapidly. In 2011, there were approximately 157 864 PwD living in an owner-occupied home, with 145 735 living in a home that is owned outright and a further 12 129 living in a mortgaged home. In 2011, there were approximately 11 756 PwD living in private rental and 8957 PwD living in public housing. The number of PwD living in public housing is expected to increase from 8957 people in 2011 to 12 916 in 2020 and 31 672 in 2050. The number of PwD living in private rental housing is expected to increase from 11 756 people in 2011 to 16 952 in 2020 and 41 570 in 2050. It is estimated that in 2011 there were 6003 CRA recipients aged 55 years and over who have dementia; 643 of these were aged 55-64 years and 5360 were aged 65 years and over. It is estimated that in 2011 there were 1742 CRA recipients aged 55 years and over who have dementia and who were experiencing housing stress; 262 of these were aged 55-64 years and 1480 were aged 65 years and over. It is estimated that in 2011, 30 per cent of PwD lived in cared accommodation, while 70 per cent lived in the community. In relation to living arrangements, in 2009 almost 9 in 10 (88%) PwD who lived in private dwellings lived with others, while 12 per cent lived alone. Men were more likely than women to have been living with others (93% and 84% respectively). In 2009, about 9 in 10 (92%) PwD living in the community were receiving care from one or more carers. Most PwD were being cared for by family, either their spouse/partner or their child/ren. Around 42 per cent of main carers of a person with dementia were the spouse/partner of the care recipient and 44 per cent were the son or daughter. PwD living in the community were most likely to need assistance with mobility (80%), followed by self-care (62%). They were least likely (39%) to need help with communication. In the final chapter, we provide an outline of the primary data collection stage of our project. This entails interviews conducted in two case sites, South Australia (SA) and Tasmania. The research team will conduct approximately 15 interviews with relevant stakeholders in each case site. Relevant stakeholders include: housing managers, social workers and aged care service providers. The research team will then conduct approximately 10 interviews with PwD and their carers across a range of low cost housing settings, including low income owner-occupiers, private rental tenants and public and community housing tenants. The interviews will be transcribed and analysed using the qualitative data analysis computer software package NVivo.",0,0,0,0
"Using technology to increase meaningful engagement in a memory care unit. Dementia is affecting an increasing number of people due to the global aging of the population. People with dementia living in memory care units (MCUs) often lack access to meaningful activities and social interactions. Information and communication technologies (ICT) have a tremendous potential to increase activity opportunities for people in MCUs. In two longitudinal studies, I used observations, interviews, and repeated quantitative measures to evaluate the use of a commercially available multifunctional technology system with people with dementia, staff, and family members. Next steps include data analysis and generating recommendations for system designers. Copyright © 2014 ACM.",1,0,0,0
"Human-robot interaction for assistance with activities of daily living: A case study of the socially and cognitively engaging brian 2.1 in the long–term care setting. The growing aging population will result in an increase in the number of elderly people suffering from social and cognitive impairments, taxing the workload of healthcare professionals. It is important that new technologies be developed to assist the elderly in completing important activities of daily living (ADLs), as well as to promote social and cognitive well-being. The objective of our research is to design socially assistive robots to provide assistance and social interaction to the elderly to improve quality of life. In order to provide effective assistance, to be engaging, and be accepted as aids during ADLs, such robots need to be able to take part in natural communication with the elderly. This chapter presents the human-like robot Brian 2.1, which utilizes speech, vocal intonation, gestures, and facial expressions to provide assistance via prompting of activity steps as well as social interactions to aid in the completion of ADLs. We compare two initial one-on-one studies in the long-term care setting, each involving two different interaction scenarios with Brian 2.1. The first is a study of a cognitively stimulating leisure activity, a memory card game (implemented in a public space), while the second investigates the important self-maintenance activity of meal-eating (implemented in a one-on-one room setting). The results of user interactions with the robot during both studies indicated that elderly participants were engaged in both activities and complied with the robot’s assistive prompts. Results of a post-study questionnaire showed that the participants accepted the robot and had positive attitudes towards its assistive and social capabilities. © 2014 Walter de Gruyter Inc., Boston/Berlin/Munich.

"Shifting perceptions, shifting identities: Communication technologies and the altered social, cultural and linguistic ecology in a remote indigenous context. While a digital divide remains evident in many remote Indigenous Australian communities, individual and collective information and communication technologies practices have developed in accordance with broadband, satellite or WiFi availability. This article examines the ways in which Indigenous youth in remote Australia are 'coming of age' in contexts where digitally-mediated social interaction is a taken-for-granted aspect of social practice, communication and learning. While there are many positive aspects to this rapid development, it can also lead to intergenerational tensions as young people explore new patterns of behaviour, and older people come to terms with new cultural challenges. Drawing on long-term ethnographic observations in Central Australia, the impact of technology and the shift in perceptions, communication modes, and social and cultural practice across the generations in the Western Desert region are traced. © 2014 Australian Anthropological Society.",0,0,0,0
"Computer-assisted direct observation of behavioral agitation, engagement, and affect in long-term care residents. Objectives: The objectives of the current research were (1) to test and evaluate the investigator-designed Behavior, Engagement, and Affect Measure (BEAM) touchpad direct observational data collection tool, and (2) to implement this tool to investigate residents' patterns of behavioral agitation, engagement, affect, behaviors associated with positive mood, general time-activity use, and social interactions within long-term care. Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",0,0,0,1
"AZ@GAME: Alzheimer and associated pathologies game for autonomy maintenance evaluation. Purpose: Alzheimer's disease and related pathologies represent a major challenge for health care systems as they cope with aging populations. It is therefore important to continuously develop tools that help clinicians to better diagnose and treat patients. Enriched Environment (EE), which promotes physical and cognitive stimulation through physical activities, cognitive challenges, and social interactions, appears to be a powerful non-pharmacological method to decrease the neurodegenerative process and cognitive impairments typically seen in Alzheimer's patients. The cognitive-enrichment-hypothesis states that and individual's behavior (including cognitive activity, social engagement, exercise, and other behaviors) has a meaningful, positive impact on their level of effective cognitive functioning in old age. This is the underlying idea for the development of Serious Games (SG). The Az@Game project is a laureate of the French Investment Funds for the Future called 'Ehealth and autonomy in their living environment thanks to digital technology'. One objective of Az@Game is to develop a SG that provides physical and cognitive stimulation for patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and related pathologies. The aim of this study is to evaluate the usability of this SG in elderly and patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease and related pathologies. Method: 'Xtorp', is a MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) SG based on a submarine game scenario. The player takes control of a submarine, and progresses by fighting other ships and completing missions. The goal is to become the best player within one month, in a contest between players and several artificial intelligences. This game offers two focuses: evaluation and stimulation. Concerning evaluation, 'Xtorp' proposes five video gaming tests, inspired by four standardized neuropsychological tests and one physical test. The performances on the standardized tests and on the video gaming tests will be compared. Concerning stimulation, subjects follow the 'Xtorp' training scenario for 30 to 60 minutes per session, in 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks. A trained exercise leader supervises all sessions. Players use a motion capture system (Kinect for PC) to control their submarine; for example, to move forward, they walk in place; to turn left, they use their left arm, and so on. Cognitive and physical test batteries are used before and after the training program to assess possible changes in capacity or ability. Results & Discussion: Enrollment started in January 2014. During evaluation, we expect to find a linear relationship between performances in real standardized tests and video gaming tests. Concerning stimulation, we expect all participants to complete the training program scenario, and expect to observe physical and cognitive improvements, especially among healthier participants.",0,0,0,1
"Falling off the bandwagon? Exploring the challenges to sustained digital engagement by older people. Objectives: This study examines older people's use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and identifies the factors which can prevent or promote their sustained use. Methods: A mixed methods approach was adopted. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected by a survey of 323 older ICT users (aged ≥50 years) between 2011 and 2012. These data were supplemented by qualitative data obtained through in-depth interviews, focus groups and storytelling. Quantitative data were analysed using PASW including bivariate and multivariate analyses. Qualitative data were analysed using an inductive, thematic approach. Results: The findings show that, contrary to some stereotypes, many older people are enthusiastic, competent and confident users of ICTs. However, they report a range of challenges in reaching and maintaining this situation. These include technological complexity and change, age-related capability changes and a lack of learning and support mechanisms. Intrinsic motivation and social support are important in enabling older people to overcome these challenges. Discussion: Getting older people online has been a high priority in many countries over the past decade. However, little attention has been paid to whether and how their usage can be sustained over time. We discuss the implications of the findings for policy and practice. © 2013 S.

"ICT as a driver for senior citizens' social inclusion. This paper deals with the problem of social inclusion of senior citizens and the role of the ICT in these prices. Modern society is marked by global processes of ageing of population and IT and computer development. But it is the elderly people who are the least accustomed to ICT use. This article presents the results of the research on pensioners' ICT usage practices which are considered as ""practices of adaptation"" that help senior citizens to integrate to the modern society, and some follow-up steps. We have compared the experience of five countries (Russia, Lithuania, Sweden, Denmark and Belarus) in ICT training of the elderly and their use of new skills. The research showed that 58% of respondents have computers at home. The elderly usually use Internet for search information (38%), reading the news (22%), corresponding with friends (33%), reading books and periodical (18%), communication via Skype (14%). The research determined the necessity of strengthening cybersecurity measures in view of the elderly features. Copyright 2014 ACM.",1,0,0,0
"Feelings of loneliness, but not social isolation, predict dementia onset: Results from the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly (AMSTEL). Background Known risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias include medical conditions, genetic vulnerability, depression, demographic factors and mild cognitive impairment. The role of feelings of loneliness and social isolation in dementia is less well understood, and prospective studies including these risk factors are scarce. Methods We tested the association between social isolation (living alone, unmarried, without social support), feelings of loneliness and incident dementia in a cohort study among 2173 non-demented community-living older persons. Participants were followed for 3 years when a diagnosis of dementia was assessed (Geriatric Mental State (GMS) Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy (AGECAT)). Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between social isolation and feelings of loneliness and the risk of dementia, controlling for sociodemographic factors, medical conditions, depression, cognitive functioning and functional status. Results After adjustment for other risk factors, older persons with feelings of loneliness were more likely to develop dementia (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.56) than people without such feelings. Social isolation was not associated with a higher dementia risk in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Feeling lonely rather than being alone is associated with an increased risk of clinical dementia in later life and can be considered a major risk factor that, independently of vascular disease, depression and other confounding factors, deserves clinical attention. Feelings of loneliness may signal a prodromal stage of dementia. A better understanding of the background of feeling lonely may help us to identify vulnerable persons and develop interventions to improve outcome in older persons at risk of dementia.",1,0,0,1
"Impact of mobile phone usage on social loneliness of elderly in Beijing. Purpose: Using a mobile phone has become an essential activity for the elderly community. With improvements in mobile phone technology, the elderly can communicate with their children or friends conveniently, which can improve their life satisfaction and subjective well-being1,2. This paper aims to describe changes in the elderly's use of mobile phones in 2010 and measure the association between use of mobile phones and social loneliness3. Method: Based on the 2010 ""Survey of the Older Population in Rural and Urban Beijing"", this paper focuses on a descriptive analysis of use of mobile phone to analyze older people's changing behaviors and then discusses the association between their mobile phone usage and social loneliness. Mobile phones can help the elderly obtain information and establish connections. This paper introduces the concept of 'social loneliness' as the most important reference of connection between the elderly and the society, and it has been operated as a subjective feeling question, namely the dependent variable. Results & Discussion: According to data analysis, mobile phones have become popular among the elderly. Only 44.3% of the elderly used mobile phones in 2006, but the number increased to 68.6% in 2010. As shown in Table 1, when demographic variables were controlled, mobile phone usage has a significant impact on social loneliness of the elderly. The more often old people use mobile phones, the less social loneliness they feel. The result shows that the necessity of using mobile phones for the elderly.

"Versatile Question-Answer Cards to Collect Personal Profiles from Seniors. Senior citizens often feel excluded from the digital world, leading to social isolation and preventing them from using personalized services to improve the quality of their lives. This can be caused by their limited skills with and passive attitudes towards the use of technologies. We tested a question-answer (Q&A) card interface to help senior citizens actively expose their personal experience, knowledge, and interests. A total of 50 senior participants answered 30,944 questions in six categories during the three months of our experiment, which indicated the Q&A interface effectively reduced the barriers for senior users to expose their profile information online. We also discuss some ways to analyze the collected data to investigate the profiles of senior citizens for the support of other new services. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",1,1,1,0
"Captioned photographs in psychosocial aged care: Relationship building and boundary work. In this paper we examine the use of a novel social technology to support the provision of formal aged care services to clients who live in their own homes. Social technologies offer enormous potential for enhancing aged care, but research on their use in aged care has largely focused on institutional or informal care settings, rather than formal care in the home. Meanwhile, technologies for aging in place typically focus on monitoring and security, rather than psychosocial support. We conducted a field study in which aged care managers used a photo and message-sharing tool to communicate with clients living in their own homes. Our findings demonstrate that visual and social forms of communication are valuable for supporting psychosocial care-giving, but there are barriers to effectively adopting new communication tools in this setting. Time constraints inhibited care managers' use of the technology, which was also influenced by their efforts to carefully maintain boundaries between their personal and professional lives.",0,1,0,0
"Psychosocial correlates of sun protection behaviors among U.S. Hispanic adults. The incidence of skin cancer among U.S. Hispanics increased 1.3 % annually from 1992 to 2008. However, little research has focused on skin cancer prevention among the rapidly growing Hispanic population. In this study, we examined theory-driven, psychosocial correlates of sun protection behaviors in a population-based sample of 787 Hispanic adults (49.6 % female, mean age = 41.0 years) residing in five southern or western U.S. states. Participants completed an English- or Spanish-language online survey in September 2011. The outcomes of focus were sunscreen use, shade seeking, and use of sun protective clothing. The correlates included suntan benefits, sun protection benefits and barriers, skin color preference, perceived natural skin protection, photo-aging concerns, perceived skin cancer risk, skin cancer worry, skin cancer fatalism, and sun protection descriptive norms. Results of multiple linear regression analyses revealed the following: sun protection barriers were negatively associated with each outcome; descriptive norms were positively associated with each outcome; perceived natural skin protection was inversely associated with sunscreen use; skin cancer worry was positively associated with shade seeking and use of sun protective clothing; skin cancer fatalism was negatively associated with shade seeking; and skin color preference was negatively associated with use of sun protective clothing. A number of additional statistically significant associations were identified in bivariate correlation analyses. This study informs the potential content of interventions to promote engagement in sun protection behaviors among U.S. Hispanics. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0,0,0,0
"A randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of online rehabilitative intervention for adult hearing-aid users. Objective: Previous research shows that the internet can be used in the rehabilitation of hearing-aid users. By further developing the online program, it might be possible to foster behavioral changes that will positively affect hearing-aid users. Design: A randomized controlled study with two groups of participants. The intervention group underwent a five-week online intervention while the control group was referred to a waiting list. Questionnaires were used as outcome measures. Study sample: Seventy-six experienced hearing-aid users participated in the study, ranging in age from 26 to 81 years (mean 69.3 years). Results: The findings showed significant improvements in the intervention group after the intervention, measured by the hearing handicap inventory for the elderly. The effects were maintained and improved at the follow-up. Furthermore, the results indicated that the participants in the intervention group improved at two items of the international outcome inventory for hearing aids, and the effects were partly maintained at the follow-up. Finally, significant improvements in the domain of psychosocial wellbeing were found at the follow-up. Conclusions: This study provides further evidence that the internet can be used to deliver intervention of rehabilitation to hearing-aid users. © 2014 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.",0,1,0,1
"Differentiating selves: Middle-aged gay men in Manchester's less visible 'homospaces'. Scholarship on gay bars/'villages' has overshadowed study of 'homospaces' (gay fields of existence) less available/inaccessible to a wider public - websites, saunas and social/support groups. Based on interviews with 27 men aged 39-61 living in Manchester, this article addresses what middle-aged gay men's accounts of these particular homospaces say about their experiences of age/ageing and how relations of ageism work within them. Specifically, I focus on how study participants use 'ageing capital' in these fields to differentiate themselves from their younger counterparts in three ways. First, ageing capital is implicated in capitulation to gay ageism and a reverse ageism - visible in accounts of differentiation from the 'superficial,' reckless ways of sexualized space that participants associated with younger gay men. Second, it was visible in accounts of resistance to/questioning of gay ageism - strategies that could make sexualized homospaces more habitable. Third, ageing capital was implicated in negotiation with ageing/gay ageism - visible in ambivalent stances hovering between compliance and resistance - towards ageing and ageism, which could reinforce constraints on uses/display of the body. The first and third accounts indicate the multidirectional character of gay ageism, limits on the deployment on ageing capital and show how middle-aged men can undermine their generational claims to represent a more authentic form of gay male embodiment. En route, I also complicate stereotypical thinking that gay social/support groups represent more inclusive, empowering space whilst overtly sexualized spaces of the 'gay scene' represent the opposite. © London School of Economics and Political Science 2014.",0,0,0,0
"Cohort profile: The Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of more than 37 000 individuals over age 50 in 23 000 households in the USA. The survey, which has been fielded every 2 years since 1992, was established to provide a national resource for data on the changing health and economic circumstances associated with ageing at both individual and population levels. Its multidisciplinary approach is focused on four broad topics-income and wealth; health, cognition and use of healthcare services; work and retirement; and family connections. HRS data are also linked at the individual level to administrative records from Social Security and Medicare, Veteran's Administration, the National Death Index and employer-provided pension plan information. Since 2006, data collection has expanded to include biomarkers and genetics as well as much greater depth in psychology and social context. This blend of economic, health and psychosocial information provides unprecedented potential to study increasingly complex questions about ageing and retirement. The HRS has been a leading force for rapid release of data while simultaneously protecting the confidentiality of respondents.

The Men Androgen Inflammation Lifestyle Environment and Stress (MAILES) Study was established in 2009 to investigate the associations of sex steroids, inflammation, environmental and psychosocial factors with cardiometabolic disease risk in men. The study population consists of 2569 men from the harmonisation of two studies: all participants of the Florey Adelaide Male Ageing Study (FAMAS) and eligible male participants of the North West Adelaide Health Study (NWAHS). The cohort has so far participated in three stages of the MAILES Study: MAILES1 (FAMAS Wave 1, from 2002-2005, and NWAHS Wave 2, from 2004-2006); MAILES2 (FAMAS Wave 2, from 2007-2010, and NWAHS Wave 3, from 2008-2010); and MAILES3 (a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) survey of all participants in the study, conducted in 2010).

"The feasibility and efficacy of technology-based support groups among family caregivers of persons with dementia. With the aging of the population the numbers of people with a chronic condition such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are expected to increase. Most people with a chronic condition, such as AD, are cared for by a family member. Although caregiving can be rewarding many caregivers experience emotional distress and physical comorbidities. In this regard, there a broad range of interventions aimed at decreasing caregiver stress. Despite the proliferation of these interventions they have only met with limited success for a variety of reasons. Information technology offers the potential of enhancing the ability of caregivers to access needed services and programs. This paper evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of technology-based psychosocial intervention for family caregivers of AD patients. Overall, the results indicated that the caregivers were enthusiastic about the program, found the technology easy to use, and indicated that the intervention enhanced their access to resources, support and caregiving skills. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",0,1,0,0
"Are octogenarians in good condition after cardiac valvular surgery?. Purpose: With the aging of society in developed countries and advances in surgical technologyin recent years, surgery is increasing in elderly patients. When performing surgeryin older patients, both surgical outcomes and the maintenance of postoperative quality oflife (QOL) are important issues. This study investigated surgical outcomes and postoperativeQOL in octogenarians who underwent cardiac valvular surgery.Methods and Results: Fifty-nine (16 males) octogenarians (80–89 years old, mean age,82.4 ± 2.4 years) underwent cardiac valvular surgery between August 1999 and June 2011.A QOL questionnaire, which included the Barthel Index (BI), Fillenbaum Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (FIADL), and the Vitality Index (VI), was sent to all survivors.Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess survival. Hospital mortality was 1.6% (1 patient).The 3-, 5-, and 7-year survival rates were 81.2%, 75.4%, and 67.8%, respectively. The BIshowed that 87.5% of patients did not require care giving, the FIADL showed that 32.5%were highly independent, and the VI showed that 87.5% were motivated to live.Conclusions: Short-term outcomes were satisfactory, with low complication and mortalityrates. Mid-term outcomes showed maintenance of the minimal required ADL and good motivation for living. However, independence in social activities was decreased, suggesting the need for comprehensive social support. © 2014 The Editorial Committee of Annals of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery.

"Investigation rural community communication for flood and bushfire preparedness. Communicating risk is vital so that communities can prepare to meet approaching natural hazards. This study examined access to emergency communications and subsequent levels of preparedness in two rural Australian communities, Ingham in Queensland and Beechworth in Victoria. In 2009 these towns experienced a flood and fire disaster respectively. Focus interview data were used to design a survey which was completed by 546 respondents across the two communities. Results showed that preparedness was most strongly predicted when emergency communications were received from neighbourhood and community member sources rather than the media or other organisations. Findings also highlighted that communities are inherently different and need targeted emergency communications, tailored to the disaster type and community composition. In particular, the elderly and the unemployed reported social isolation and less access to mobile phone and internet communications. The findings show that emergency communications need to be two-way so that those at risk in an emergency can access specific advice about their household and what action to take to protect themselves and their property. Neighbourhood influences appear to be important in mobilising preparedness actions in the two communities studied.",0,0,0,0
"Never too old to use a tablet: Designing tablet applications for the cognitively and physically impaired elderly. People live longer than ever before and the population of elderly is increasing. Many elderly visit day care centres in order to avoid loneliness and continuously look for new methods of entertainment. A possible new mean of entertainment can be found in the use of tablet applications. However, due to the physical and/or cognitive impairments of these elderly, most tablet applications are not accessible. This research tries to design an elderly-friendly entertainment application. Several design guidelines were determined via a literature review and a contextual inquiry for the design of three prototypes. These prototypes successfully eliminated problems concerning button size, navigation, readability of the fonts and swiping. Furthermore, results indicated that the elderly had a strong preference for the design which had a low number of icons, a more direct way of giving information, no deep hierarchy, larger buttons with immediate feedback when pressed, a clear notification that the screens had changed and the screens which used bright colours were more effective. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",1,0,0,0
"Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial. Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",0,1,0,1
"The experiences of parents whose children have emigrated [Die belewenisse van ouers wie se kinders emigreer het]. This research focuses on the manner in which parents experience the emigration of their children. Migration of people, both within a country and across borders, is a global phenomenon. South Africa has diverse historical and contemporary migration patterns, and there are various factors underlying emigration; these may be of an economic, social or personal nature. A general theory regarding the causes of migration distinguishes between push and pull factors. Pull factors include personal safety in society, a better standard of living as well as various job opportunities. Push factors in South Africa, among others, include dissatisfaction of the standard of public and commercial services, perceptions of moral decline in society, an unemployment-rate of 25.6% (Statistics SA 2013) and dissatisfaction with affirmative action issues. One of the main push factors in South Africa is the high level of crime. The desire to travel and a sense of adventure also play a part in people's decision to emigrate. The country's database and statistics on emigration flows are inadequate; and the impact of emigration on the mental health of the families who have been left behind, especially parents, remains a neglected topic in South Africa. According to media reports, South Africa is suffering from the effects of a ""brain-drain"", and the country is also exposed to free trade agreements and globalising tendencies. Each person leaving the country leaves behind a family. The effects on those who have to remain in South Africa, particularly the parents, have yet to be sufficiently researched. Part of the parents' psycho-social support system suddenly falls away when their children emigrate. Some parents lose all their children as a result of emigration. The communication and interaction with their children on different continents become complex. A contributing factor to poor communication is parents' inability to utilize technology as a means of staying in contact with their children. These parents are usually middle-aged and some of them even older, and are dependent on other people for their daily care. They have to adapt to the new circumstances in this relatively advanced phase in their lives. In previous generations, this used to be a phase in which people slowed down, retired and settled down to enjoy their grandchildren. After their children's emigration, they are no longer able to see their grandchildren growing up; in a significant way, they are being excluded from their children's daily life. Some of the parents relied on their children to take care of them in later years and suddenly they have to try and find alternative support systems. A Christian existential paradigm was used, which, in searching to find meaning in life and to make responsible choices, views a person as a whole entity. The framework of the Theory of Health Promotion (Department of Nursing 2010) forms the philosophical and theoretical basis, as the phenomenon of emigration impacts on families as a system; seeing that the abovementioned theory follows a holistic perspective, it should adequately address families' sense of loss. A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual study of the experiences of parents whose children had emigrated, was done by using community radio as the medium of interaction. The community radio was used to invite parents whose children had emigrated to participate in this research. The radio medium is a powerful, cost-effective medium with which to reach thousands of people at the same time. It is also ideal for psycho-educational purposes because of the convenience to listen to it in your house, car or while doing something else. The aim was to facilitate the mental health of those parents who had been left behind. Indepth interviews were conducted with 16 parents after broadcasting an invitation to participate in the study by means of a community radio station. The population was Afrikaans-speaking people with a Christian tradition. The average period of their children's emigration was nine years. All the parents' children had emigrated longer than one year ago. The following was found: parents whose children emigrate experience a feeling of disillusionment, expressed in the words ""we raise them to leave us!"" The loss is ambiguous, with a main feeling of helplessness; their affective response painfully fluctuates. The experience is unique and personal and parents apply effective and less effective coping mechanisms in order to deal with the ambiguous loss. Copyright © Sabinet 2014.",0,0,0,0
"Cohort Profile: The Hawai'i Family Study of Cognition. Intergenerational longitudinal studies over the lifespan provide valuable information for understanding the contexts and dynamic relations among cognition, family and health in adults and the elderly. The Hawai'i Family Study of Cognition (HFSC), initiated in the early 1970s, included a cohort of over 6500 individuals representing over 1800 families of parents and their offspring. The HFSC gathered data on cognitive, personality, biological and other psychosocial variables, and provided novel information on the nature of cognitive abilities, especially on family issues. Some families were reassessed with short-term retesting in the 1970s. A select sample of offspring and their siblings and spouses were re-measured in the 1980s. Decades later, a 40-year follow-up of the original HFSC cohort was facilitated by the availability of contemporary tracking and tracing methods and internet-based testing. A subgroup of the original HFSC participants was re-contacted and retested on contemporary cognitive as well as socio-demographic and health measures. In this paper, we describe the original HFSC cohort and the design and methodology of the re-contact and retest studies of the HFSC, plans for expanding the re-contact and retesting, as well as directions for future research and collaborations.

"Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system. Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",0,0,0,1
"Older adults and the use of internet communication: Results from a German study-sample. Background: Although much is known about communication patterns of young people, communication habits of older people still seem to be to be a neglected area of research. This seems surprising considering the great importance of information exchange, especially for this age group. Communication enables older people to participate in social life and thus can prevent loneliness and isolation. Methods: After conducting a systematic literature search a questionnaire was designed to assess possible factors influencing the use of the internet for communication reasons. 150 persons aged 60 years and older were asked about socio-demographic information, conversation durations and dialogue partners. Additionally, participants were asked about subjective advantages and disadvantages of internet communication. Results: Almost 50 % of the participants reported using the internet for communication (mainly e-mail). In particular, the socio-demographic factors age, gender and education influenced the use of internet for communication. Besides socio-demographic factors, we demonstrated that daily telephone use influences the use of the internet for communication. Contrary to our expectations, family situation, mobility and size of living area had no impact in this study-sample. Conclusion: Using the internet for communication can be a possible solution to some of the problems many older people have to face, such as loneliness and isolation. Currently, the internet is used by only a small part of older adults. In order to strengthen internet communication in older people, it is necessary to know about factors influencing the use of internet for communication. © 2013 The authors and IOS Press.

"Experiences of older people using videoconferencing in home care - A case study of telecare from Finland. The objective of this qualitative case study is to explore home care patients' perceptions of a videoconference system as part of their home care. The study also aims to examine how the possibility to form a video connection with nursing staff affects home care patients' feelings of loneliness and security. Seven home care patients' perceptions of the used videoconference system were surveyed using semi-structured interviews with themes based on technology acceptance literature. The gathered research material was analyzed thematically. The study is part of a larger KOVI project. The interviewed home care patients felt they had a natural conversation through the videoconference device. The individuals' views of the usefulness of videoconference technology seemed to be an essential factor in the acceptance and use of technology. The use of the videoconference device was not considered particularly challenging, so the ease of the use of technology and learning to use the device were not considered a major challenge, not even for the elderly. The customers were worried about the privacy because of the installed cameras, but considered the safety the system brings more important. The lack of previous knowledge concerning technology, however, was noted in situations that deviated from common usage of the equipment. Guidance and instructions in difficult situations and maintenance of the device were deemed important. © 2013 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.",1,0,0,0
"TRiCmini + - a telepresence robot for interpersonal communication for older adults. Aging is associated with an increased risk of isolation. Information and communication technologies have been utilized to assist homecare of older adults. However, in addition to transmitting vital sign data for healthcare purposes, older adults may expect to share their life experiences and feelings by different forms of interactions with their children and family members. Communication tools did facilitate interpersonal communication in terms of real-time verbal communication. Nevertheless, nonverbal communication, such as facial expression and body language, is more powerful and efficient in conveying ideas, thoughts, and emotions. ""TRiCmini +"" is a telepresence robot for interpersonal communication. It demonstrates extensive capability to provide different levels of ""care delivery"" to older adults through vital sign monitoring, interpersonal communication, robotic movements, and social network integration. TRiCmini + integrates two distinct applications, the ""Care Delivery Frame (CDF)"" and the telepresence robot. CDF is an App designed for older adults as an information channel on the tablet PC, which is also the ""face"" of TRiCmini +. CDF is integrated with social network services, and remote caregivers can share messages, photos or video clips with older adults. Moreover, the tablet is also the control center of the robot. In this innovative control structure, the robot control App can be downloaded and maintained easily through the Internet. The prototype and functional test of TRiCmini + have been completed. Currently it is under usability evaluation, including the interface design and operation efficiency for both remote and local users. Finally, the effectiveness of communication will be evaluated in real application scenarios to confirm the ""care delivery"" in different forms provided by TRiCmini + actually meets the expectation of older adults.",0,0,0,0
"Building a client-server social network application for elders and safety net. Social inclusion is one of the major challenges for the elderly living alone. An active social life is connected in many ways to both mental and physical well-being. As the online social networks are getting more common in peoples social lives, there is therefore a growing need for social applications that are designed for the elderly. In this paper we present design and implementation of the AMCOSOP system that enables the elderly to stay connected with their families, friends and safety network even though they are living by themselves. Consisting of a touchscreen user interface and web-based solutions, the AMCOSOP system was used in field trials in two countries for several months. Copyright © 2013 ACM.",1,1,1,0
"Residents' perceptions and experiences of social interaction and participation in leisure activities in residential aged care. Social interaction and participation in leisure activities are positively related to the health and well-being of elderly people. The main focus of this exploratory study was to investigate elderly peoples' perceptions and experiences of social interaction and leisure activities living in a residential aged care (RAC) facility. Six residents were interviewed. Themes emerging from discussions about their social interactions included: importance of family, fostering friendships with fellow residents, placement at dining room tables, multiple communication methods, and minimal social isolation and boredom. Excursions away from the RAC facility were favourite activities. Participants commonly were involved in leisure activities to be socially connected. Poor health, family, the RAC facility, staffi ng, transportation, and geography influenced their social interaction and participation in leisure activities. The use of new technologies and creative problem solving with staff are ways in which residents could enhance their social lives and remain engaged in leisure activities. © eContent Management Pty Ltd.",1,0,0,0
"Making sense of mobile- and web-based wellness information technology: cross-generational study.. A recent trend in personal health and wellness management is the development of computerized applications or information and communication technologies (ICTs) that support behavioral change, aid the management of chronic conditions, or help an individual manage their wellness and engage in a healthier lifestyle. To understand how individuals across 3 generations (young, middle-aged, and older) think about the design and use of collaborative health and wellness management technologies and what roles these could take in their lives. Face-to-face semistructured interviews, paper prototype systems, and video skits were used to assess how individuals from 3 age cohorts (young: 18-25 years; middle-aged: 35-50 years; and older: ≥65 years) conceptualize the role that health and wellness computing could take in their lives. A total of 21 participants in the 3 age cohorts took part (young: n=7; middle-aged: n=7; and older: n=7). Young adults expected to be able to actively manage the presentation of their health-related information. Middle-aged adults had more nuanced expectations that reflect their engagement with work and other life activities. Older adults questioned the sharing of health information with a larger audience, although they saw the value in 1-way sharing between family members or providing aggregated information. Our findings inform our suggestions for improving the design of future collaborative health and wellness applications that target specific age groups. We recommend that collaborative ICT health applications targeting young adults should integrate with existing social networking sites, whereas those targeting middle-aged and older adults should support small social networks that rely on intimate personal relationships. Systems that target middle-aged adults should support episodic needs, such as time-sensitive, perhaps intermittent, goal setting. They should also have a low barrier to entry, allowing individuals who do not normally engage with the Internet to participate with the application for the specific purposes of health engagement. Collaborative ICT health applications targeting older adults should allow discreet 1-way sharing, and also support sharing of information in aggregate with others' data. These systems should also provide mechanisms to preselect recipients of different kinds of data, or to easily direct specific information to individuals in real time.",0,0,0,0
"Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?. Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews. This paper presents findings from the pilot study, and from these findings outlines the main study and future work in investigating and improving the game's benefits.",1,0,0,0
"The anticipated positive psychosocial impact of present web-based E-health services and future mobile health applications: An investigation among older Swedes. This study investigates the anticipated psychosocial impact of present web-based e-health services and future mobile health applications among older Swedes. Random sample's of Swedish citizens aged 55 years old and older were given a survey containing two different e-health scenarios which respondents rated according to their anticipated psychosocial impact by means of the PIADS instrument. Results consistently demonstrated the positive anticipation of psychosocial impacts for both scenarios. The future mobile health applications scored more positively than the present web-based e-health services. An increase in age correlated positively to lower impact scores. These findings indicate that from a psychosocial perspective, web-based e-health services and mobile health applications are likely to positively impact quality of life. This knowledge can be helpful when tailoring and implementing e-health services that are directed to older people. © 2013 S. Wiklund Axelsson et al.",0,0,0,0
"Technology for psychosocial interventions for individuals with Alzheimer's: Reminiscence therapy and monitoring progressive decline of cognitive abilities. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing problem that affects the lives of diagnosed individuals and their caregivers. Many AD patients and their caregivers find the symptoms of memory loss and emotional distress the most challenging and distressing effects of the disease. Psychosocial therapy is often sought for symptoms affecting memory, communication, the ability to learn new skills and behavioral problems such as agitation, aggression, and depression. In this paper, we describe interactive technologies designed as catalysts for longitudinal monitoring of memory decline for people with AD and for facilitating interactions between caregivers and people with Alzheimer's. Design considerations for elderly patients, variability of visual and auditory memory cues, and implications for objectively monitoring the progressive decline of memory in the context of reminiscence therapy are discussed. © 2013 The Science and Information Organization.",0,0,0,0
"Content analysis on user-focused support features of health support sites for geriatric depression. With the unique characteristics of anonymity and non-physical interaction, the Internet has provided numerous depression support sites that can enable older people with stigmatized illness to seek for health information and acquire social support effectively. However, few studies have been conducted to evaluate the sites on user-focused support features for geriatric depression. Hence, in this paper, we report a study using content analysis with a hybrid coding approach to systematically analyze and assess the usefulness and usability of 60 depression-related sites worldwide, with 27 Asia-based and 33 Western-based. The intention of the study was to determine the benefits of these sites for geriatric depression. We formulated a research tool, a checklist of user-focused support features, critical to the effectiveness of depression sites in four aspects - purposes, information quality, interactivity and accessibility. Findings have reflected an overall high coverage of depression information in the sites in general description (93.3%), causes (76.7%), symptoms (90.0%) and treatment (88.3%), although most of them were not elderly-focused. New forms of 'patient-to-helper' and 'patient-to-patient' interaction types were observed in the sites with high social media involvement, yet more assistant features need to be introduced in order to address elderly users' physical and cognitive problems. Western sites were more likely to be depression-focused, while Asian sites have higher percentage of features for assisting elderly. We believe the findings will benefit web developers and healthcare researchers in building depression sites with higher quality and user experience for elderly users. © 2013 IEEE.",0,0,0,0
"Go-myLife: A context-aware social networking platform adapted to the needs of elderly users. In our increasingly dislocated and mobile society, online social network sites are proving valuable in bridging distances and facilitating interaction and communication. People are spending a significant amount of time at the top social networking websites in order to manage existing relationships with friends, reconnect with old friends, share media and find new contacts that have similar interests. Fulfilling these needs are just as important for elderly people as it is for everyone else, but can become more difficult. Many are no longer at work so they do not have a daily set of activities with the same group of people. This, combined with increasing frailty, can lead to a habit of staying at home, which adds to the feeling of loneliness and isolation. In spite of this need for social contact, elderly people, even those who use the internet, tend to miss out on the benefits of online social networking platforms. Elderly people are keen to maintain contact with the different generations of their family. Many older people have already invested significant time in building contact lists and relationships within the major social networks. Go-myLife has therefore not attempted to set up a new social network but rather a platform from where elderly people can post messages and receive updates and take part in discussions across a variety of platforms, thus bringing existing communities together. In this paper, the authors present a context-aware social networking platform, the ""Going online: my social life"" platform, which is adapted to the needs of elderly users. © 2013 ACM.",1,0,0,0
"Communication and coordination for institutional dementia caregiving in China. With a general trend worldwide towards greater life expectancies, interventions and tools that can help caregivers working in elder care are becoming increasingly important. In China, with a greater number and proportion of elders due to the long-term effects of the one-child policy, these interventions and tools are needed even more. Improved communication between care staff of an institutional home can reduce medical errors and improve coordination of care. At the same time, increased conversation with elders with cognitive impairments like dementia or Alzheimer's can help the elder to maintain their cognitive ability, and can reduce negative feelings like loneliness. Our qualitative study with eleven institutional caregivers in Beijing delved into the communication patterns that exist between caregivers and elders with dementia. We found that knowing more about each individual resident's disposition and personal history was helpful in maintaining quality care, that many care staff in China use placating talk as a means to calm or guide elders to a desired action, and that care staff found the topic of past careers or past 'glories' to be the most efficient in getting elders to chat. In addition, we also found that much of the information that is gleaned through working with an elder long-term is not recorded or shared in any official capacity with other care workers, an area where technology could be particularly helpful.",0,0,0,0
"Design and Technologies for Understanding Older Adults Social Interactions in Retirement Communities. Social interactions in retirement communities' shared spaces are a key component to preventing social isolation and loneliness among older people. Given the underutilization of these spaces, placing technologies to promote utilization of- and socialization in- shared spaces might improve independence and quality of life among older adults. The purpose of this paper is to describe the design, development, and technology studies conducted for understanding the social interactions of older adults in retirement communities. To understand current use of shared spaces, observational studies were conducted in a retirement community. Moreover, interventions were implemented to evaluate the impact of designed technologies in shared spaces. The results motivate the need for an automated behavioral mapping surveillance system to quantify social interactions among older adults and technology interventions in retirement communities' shared common areas. This paper describes the development of a video-based analysis system for understanding social interactions among older adults in retirement communities. Specific emphasis is given to describing the automated behavioral mapping surveillance system designed to monitor the number, length, and type of interactions of older adults in retirement communities. We hypothesize that social interactions amongst older adults can be detected using video cameras and microphones strategically placed in the environment, and discuss the development of a surveillance system specifically for quantifying social interaction. This study is relevant for the field of social robotics as an example of a realistic application domain. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",1,1,1,0
"Sexually transmitted infections and older adults. Older adults continue to be sexually active in their later years. A range of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV have been reported among older adults. Risk factors for STIs in older populations include (a) normal sexual changes associated with aging (e.g., increased time to attain an erection, decreased vaginal lubrication, decreases in sexual hormones); (b) psychosocial changes (e.g., loss of partner or spouse and re-entering the dating scene); and (c) risky sexual behaviors, including no or infrequent use of condoms. Screening of adults for STIs should occur regardless of age based on guidelines such as those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. As discussed in this article, nurses can use assessment guides and engage in interventions such as counseling and education with older adults to reduce STI risk or refer for treatment. Numerous online resources exist for both nurses and older adults to increase knowledge of STIs.",0,0,0,0
"Outcomes from a peer tutor model for teaching technology to older adults. A key component of social work ethics is social justice and equitable access to resources. Increasingly, this includes access to technology. This study addresses issues related to the 'digital divide' by testing a peer tutor model (Technology and Aging Project, TAP2) to teach adults aged 60 and older how to use information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as email, the internet, online chat rooms and discussion groups, internet-based support groups, and voice technology and webcams. Participants from the control group of a previous programme, TAP1 (N=19) participated in a six-month computer training programme. Six participants who had successfully completed the TAP1 training were selected to be peer tutors. Data were collected from tutors and learners at baseline, three months, six months and nine months (three months after the end of training). The current study reports on learner outcomes only. Measures include computer, social support, and mental health-related outcomes. Learners reported a significant and consistent increase over time in their confidence completing certain computer-related tasks and their overall use of ICTs. Mental health and social support outcomes did not change. Overall, the peer tutor model appeared to be at least as effective as the previous staff-directed model. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.",1,1,1,0
"AGNES: Connecting people in a multimodal way. Western societies are confronted with a number of challenges caused by the increasing number of older citizens. One important aspect is the need and wish of older people to live as long as possible in their own home and maintain an independent life. As people grew older, their social networks disperse, with friends and families moving to other parts of town, other cities or even countries. Additionally, people become less mobile with age, leading to less active participation in societal life. Combined, this normal, age-related development leads to increased loneliness and social isolation of older people, with negative effects on mental and physical health of those people. In the AGNES project, a home-based system has been developed that allows connecting elderly with their families, friends and other significant people over the Internet. As most older people have limited experience with computers and often special requirements on technology, one focus of AGNES was to develop with the users novel technological means for interacting with their social network. The resulting system uses ambient displays, tangible interfaces and wearable devices providing ubiquitous options for interaction with the network, and secondary sensors for additionally generating carefully chosen information on the person to be relayed to significant persons. Evaluations show that the chosen modalities for interaction are well adopted by the users. Further it was found that use of the AGNES system had positive effects on the mental state of the users, compared to the control group without the technology. © 2013 OpenInterface Association.",1,1,1,0
"A socialization intervention in remote health coaching for older adults in the home. Previous studies have shown that social ties enhance both physical and mental health, and that social isolation has been linked to increased cognitive decline. As part of our cognitive training platform, we created a socialization intervention to address these issues. The intervention is designed to improve social contact time of older adults with remote family members and friends using a variety of technologies, including Web cameras, Skype software, email and phone. We used usability testing, surveys, interviews and system usage monitoring to develop design guidance for socialization protocols that were appropriate for older adults living independently in their homes. Our early results with this intervention show increased number of social contacts, total communication time (we measure email, phone, and Skype usage) and significant participant satisfaction with the intervention. © 2013 IEEE.",1,1,1,0
"Internet use and decision making in community-based older adults. Use of the internet may provide tools and resources for better decision making, yet little is known about the association of internet use with decision making in older persons. We examined this relationship in 661 community-dwelling older persons without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, an ongoing longitudinal study of aging. Participants were asked to report if they had access to the internet and how frequently they used the internet and email. A 12-item instrument was used to assess financial and healthcare decision making using materials designed to approximate those used in real world settings. Items were summed to yield a total decision making score. Associations were tested via linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, race, education, and a measure of global cognitive function. Secondary models further adjusted for income, depression, loneliness, social networks, social support, chronic medical conditions, instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), life space size, and health and financial literacy. Interaction terms were used to test for effect modification. Almost 70% of participants had access to the internet, and of those with access, 55% used the internet at least several times a week. Higher frequency of internet use was associated with better financial and healthcare decision making (β = 0.11, p = 0.002). The association persisted in a fully adjusted model (β = 0.08, p = 0.024). Interaction models indicated that higher frequency of internet use attenuated the relationships of older age, poorer cognitive function, and lower levels of health and financial literacy with poorer healthcare and financial decision making. These findings indicate that internet use is associated with better health and financial decision making in older persons. Future research is required to understand whether promoting the use of the internet can produce improvements in healthcare and financial decision making. © 2013 James, Boyle, Yu and Bennett.",1,0,0,0
"Design and evaluation of a telepresence robot for interpersonal communication with older adults. Aging is associated with an increased risk of isolation. Interpersonal communication with family members, friends, and caregivers is crucial to healthy aging. This paper presents a telepresence robot ""TRiC mini+"" which can be used as an agent of the children or caregivers in an older adult's home environment, to duplicate three dimensional face-to-face interpersonal communications. TRiCmini+ can be separated into the ""brain (a tablet)"" and the ""body (the robotic vehicle)"". With this structure, the robot control software is an App which can be downloaded, maintained and updated easily through the Internet. TRiC mini+ is integrated with social network services such as Google Talk and Facebook, to provide a wide range of communication and information sharing easily and conveniently. The effectiveness of using TRiCmini+ in communication is evaluated. The results showed that the telepresence performance in both verbal and nonverbal ways is better than the traditional telepresence robot without nonverbal way of interpersonal communication. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",1,0,0,0
"Effects of technology and connectedness on community-dwelling older adults. Purpose: To examine the relationship between technology and connectedness in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: Survey was collected conducted using convenience sampling of 86 community-dwelling older adults to assess their use of technology and examine the association between use of technology and connectedness. Findings: Results indicated that as age increases, activities with technology decrease (r=-0.43). Interest, skills and intent in using technology were weakly correlated with feelings of how to face aging, being spiritual and being part of a family. Participants did not believe that cost (69%), poor eyesight or physical impairments (88%) were barriers to using technology. Interestingly 35% ofthe subjects used the web to search for health information, 44% used the phone or computer to search information and 43% kept in touch with family online. Conclusions: This study is a beginning in our understanding about the potential role of technology in improving connectedness and alleviating isolation in community-dwelling older adults.",1,0,0,1
"Testing a theory-based mobility monitoring protocol using in-home sensors: a feasibility study.. Mobility is a key factor in the performance of many everyday tasks required for independent living as a person ages. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to test a theory-based mobility monitoring protocol by comparing sensor-based measures to self-report measures of mobility and assess the acceptability of in-home sensors with older adults. Standardized instruments to measure physical, psychosocial, and cognitive parameters were administered to 8 community-dwelling older adults at baseline, 3-month, and 6-month visits. Semi-structured interviews to characterize acceptability of the technology were conducted at the 3-month and 6-month visits. Technical issues prevented comparison of sensor-based measures with self-report measures. In-home sensor technology for monitoring mobility is acceptable to older adults. Implementing our theory-based mobility monitoring protocol in a field study in the homes of older adults is a feasible undertaking but requires more robust technology for sensor-based measure validation.

"Nurses aged over 50 years and their experiences of shift work. Aim: The Late Career Nurse project examined views and characteristics of nurses working in New Zealand who were born before 1960. This paper focuses on the experiences of such nurses who undertake shift work. Background: The mean age of registered nurses in New Zealand has been rising steadily, and 40% are now aged 50 years or over. While there is substantial literature on the phenomenon and consequences of the ageing nursing workforce, little is known of the particular experiences of nurses aged over 50 years who work shifts. Method: An anonymous online survey was emailed to eligible nurse New Zealand Nurses Organisation members aged over 50 years in February 2012. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the 3273 responses received were undertaken. Result: Over 45% of respondents worked shifts or flexible hours. While shift work suited many, others noted deleterious effects on family and social relationships, physical and mental health (notably sleep patterns and fatigue), and decreasing tolerance for shift work as they age. Poor scheduling practices were particularly detrimental. Conclusion and implications for nursing management: Worldwide, workforce ageing means strategies are required to retain older nurses in the workforce. Improved scheduling practices including increasing access to flexible and part time work hours, and development of resources on coping with shift work are recommended. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0,0,0,1
"Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens. Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",1,0,0,1
"Use or non-use of gerontechnology-A qualitative study. This study employed a qualitative approach to explore the attitudes and experiences of older people towards using gerontechnology, and to determine the underlying reasons that might account for their use and non-use of gerontechnology. Four focus group discussions and 26 individual interviews were undertaken. Qualitative data were analyzed using NVivo software and were categorized using coding and grounded theory techniques. The result indicated that old people in Hong Kong had an overall positive attitude toward technology. Positive attitudes were most frequently related to enhanced convenience and advanced features. Negative attitudes were most frequently associated with health risks and social problems arising from using technology (e.g., social isolation and addiction). Usage of technology is driven by outcome expectations and social influences, and supported by facilitators, whereas non-use of gerontechnology relates to the personal (e.g., health and functional capacities), technological (e.g., cost and complexity), and environmental barriers experienced. Use of gerontechnology is a synthesis of person, technology, and environment. To encourage non-users to adopt technology, there is a need to remove barriers at personal, technological, and environmental levels. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",1,0,0,0
"Interactive caringTV®supporting elderly living at home. Background Interactive CaringTV® is a Finnish innovation that was developed by Laurea University of Applied Sciences in 2006. CaringTV was developed through action research during three research projects. The aim of interactive CaringTV is to support the health and well-being of elderly people living in their own homes. Method The Safe Home project was based on action research, userdriven methods, and a case study. User-driven methods were applied in planning, implementing and evaluating the programme and eServices e.g. testing and evaluating peer support, including eConsultation as the methods for supporting clientś coping with life in their own homes. Costeffectiveness and process modelling were studied through the case study. Results The user-driven approach and the collected data formed the basis for the interactive programme. The online CaringTV programme included content to: support everyday life for the elderly, safety, and activities of daily living, support social relationships, participate in rehabilitation and physical exercises, manage self-care, and health issues. Active participation in the CaringTV programme provided functional ability and everyday coping as well as a meaningful activity in everyday life. Conclusion CaringTV is an interactive platform to support elderly in their everyday life and help them cope at home. User-driven methods enable participantś active involvement in planning interactive and online programmes and eServices via CaringTV. The ultimate goal of the CaringTV is to support elderlýs health, wellbeing and interaction.

"Retrospective privacy: Managing longitudinal privacy in online social networks. Online social networks provide access to the user's information for long periods of time after the information's initial publication. In this paper, we investigate the relation between information aging and its sharing preferences on Facebook. Our findings are based on a survey of 193 Facebook users, in which we asked users to specify their sharing preferences and intentions towards posts that were published in different periods of time (from the time of the survey and up to 24 months prior to the time of the survey.) Our results show that willingness to share significantly drops with the time passed since publishing the post. The occurrence of life changes, such as graduating from college or moving to a new town, is correlated with a further decrease in the willingness to share. We discuss our findings by relating it to information aging theories and privacy theories. Finally, we use our results to reflect on privacy mechanisms for long-term usage of online social networks, such as expiry date for content and historical information reviewing processes.",0,0,0,0
"Influence of psychosocial factors on the energy and protein intake of older people on dialysis. Objective: To explore the relationship between nutritional parameters and psychosocial factors in older people on dialysis. Design: A cross-sectional observational study in prevalent older people on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Setting: A secondary analysis from a quality of life study in older people (Broadening Options for Long-term Dialysis in the Elderly). Subjects: One-hundred and six patients 65 years of age or older and on dialysis for at least 90 days were purposively recruited (HD patients matched to PD patients by age, sex, dialysis vintage, ethnicity and Index of Deprivation). Half were on HD, the mean age was 72.7 years, 72% were male, 92% were from a White ethnic background, and 26% had diabetes. Intervention: The patients attended one visit at which they completed nutritional assessments (3-day food diary, subjective global assessment, handgrip strength, and body mass index) and questionnaires: Short Form-12 (SF-12), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Mini Mental State Exam, and social networks. Main outcome measures: The differences in nutritional parameters between patients on PD and HD were determined by univariate analyses, and the relationships between nutritional intake and demographic, clinical, and psychosocial variables were determined by multivariate analyses. Results: There was no difference in the energy and protein intake and nutritional status between older people on HD and PD. For the whole sample, multivariate analyses found that lower energy intake was related to fewer social networks (P = .002) and lower SF-12 Physical Component Scale (PCS) scores (P = .021). A lower protein intake was related to worsening Index of Deprivation scores (P= .028) and an interaction between SF-12 PCS and presence of possible depression (P = .015). Conclusion: Energy and protein intake in older people (regardless of modality) appears to be independently associated with psychosocial variables. © 2013 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.",1,0,0,1
"Question first: Passive interaction model for gathering experience and knowledge from the elderly. We propose the 'Question First' interaction model, which aims to reduce the barriers to accessing online mobile information transmission for the elderly and aggregate their useful experience and knowledge for younger generations. 'Question First' helps elderly users to transfer their knowledge or experiences by simply answering questions through conventional mobile terminals. The proposed interaction model is based on extending conventional interaction modes of phone calls and emails, helping elderly users become familiar with social networking, without the requirement of learning to use social networking service interfaces. Ultimately, we aim to expand the social participation of the elderly in both online communication and online work such as crowdsourcing. We report the results of a two-week user study on the crowdsourcing of participants' experience and knowledge through online communication, and analyze the information obtained to evaluate the efficiency of this interaction model by extracting features of each participant's knowledge and experience via the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.",1,0,0,0

"Service-based health human resources planning for older adults. Objectives: To test a service-based health human resources (HHR) planning approach for older adults in the context of home and long term care (LTC); to create a practical template/tools for use in various jurisdictions and/or health care settings. Design: The most serious health needs of seniors in 2 Canadian jurisdictions were identified and linked to the specific services and associated competencies required of health care providers (HCPs) to address those needs. The amounts of each service required were quantified and compared against the capacity of HCPs to perform the services, measured using a self-assessment survey, by using a previously developed analytical framework. Setting: Home and LTC sectors in Nova Scotia and Nunavut, Canada. Participants: Regulated and nonregulated HCPs were invited to complete either an online or paper-based competency self-assessment survey. Results: Survey response rates in Nova Scotia and Nunavut were 11% (160 responses) and 20% (22responses), respectively. Comparisons of the estimated number of seniors likely to need each service with the number who can be served by the workforces in each jurisdiction indicated that the workforces in both jurisdictions are sufficiently numerous, active, productive, and competent to provide most of the services likely to be required. However, significant gaps were identified in pharmacy services, ongoing client assessment, client/family education and involvement, and client/family functional and social supports. Conclusion: Service-based HHR planning is feasible for identifying gaps in services required by older adults, and can guide policy makers in planning hiring/recruitment, professional development, and provider education curricula. Implementation will require commitment of policy makers and other stakeholders, as well as ongoing evaluation of its effectiveness. More broadly, the ongoing effectiveness of the approach will depend on workforce planning being conducted in an iterative way, driven by regular reevaluation of population health needs and HHR effectiveness. © 2013 American Medical Directors Association, Inc.",0,0,0,1
"Interaction design for robotic avatars does avatar's aging cue affect the user's impressions of a robot?. Human Computer/Robot Interaction has concerned about developing embodied computer/robot agents effective for their use in user interaction. In particular, the study on the dependency of the interaction design on the target users has been of a core theme to investigate. For instance, in the case of designing an embodied agent such as an avatar specifically to support the performance of a robot assistant to the elderly, the aspect of social interaction with the older adults should be of a serious concern. In this paper, we present a study that explores the relationship between the degree of aging cues (i.e., the visual features related to the age of embodied agents) and the level of perceived anthropomorphism, intelligence, safety and likeability by the older adults as customers. The study found that avatar aging cues affect the perception of the older adults in intelligence and safety: the older adults perceived the agent more intelligent with older avatars but safer with younger avatars. However, the aging cue seems not affecting the sense of anthropomorphism and likeability on users. An Interesting finding is the difference in the likability associated with the aging cue according to the gender of the older adults: the male participants tend to like older avatars while the female participants the younger ones. Since how the older adults perceive the aging cues of avatars could affect their expectation and trust on the assistant robots, thus, the findings related to the aging cue influence in the design of a series of attributions of the robots in terms of their roles and capabilities. Based on the results of this work, we can approach toward design considerations to help guide interaction designers in creating the visual appearance of an embodied agency as the robotic avatar interfaces for the elderly. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",1,0,0,0
"Toward a virtual companion for the elderly: Exploring the behaviors that potentially achieve rapport in human communication. The elderly who live alone are increasing rapidly in these years. For their mental health, it is reported useful to maintain their social life with others. This work is aiming to develop a companion agent who can engage long-term relationship with the elderly users. This paper presents our first step to explore the rapport occurred in a human-human communication which is considered to be essential in keeping social relationship with others. We analyzed the corpus collected in a human-human dyadic conversation experiment from three view points, the speaker (potential user), the listener, and the third person who did not participate the conversation. Encouraging results that may provide the hints of agent development were found in the analysis: The attitude of the conversation can have an influence on the speaker's mood, the mood of the speaker can be potentially observed by another person, and the third person can detect speaker's attitude. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",1,0,0,0
"National survey of yoga practitioners: Mental and physical health benefits. Objectives: To describe yoga practice and health characteristics of individuals who practice yoga, and to explore their beliefs regarding the effects of their yoga practice on their health. Design: A cross-sectional design with anonymous online surveys. Setting: 4307 randomly selected individuals from 15 US Iyengar yoga studios (n= 18,160), representing 41 states; 1087 individuals responded, with 1045 (24.3%) surveys completed. Outcome measures: Freiberg Mindfulness Inventory, Mental Health Continuum (subjective well-being), Multi-factor Screener (diet), PROMIS sleep disturbance, fatigue, and social support, International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Results: Age: 19-87 years (M= 51.7 ± 11.7), 84.2% female, 89.2% white, 87.4% well educated (≥bachelor's degree). Mean years of yoga practice = 11.4 (±7.5). BMI = 12.1-49.4 (M= 23.1 ± 3.9). Levels of obesity (4.9%), smoking (2%), and fruit and vegetable consumption (M= 6.1 ± 1.1) were favorable compared to national norms. 60% reported at least one chronic/serious health condition, yet most reported very good (46.3%) or excellent (38.8%) general health. Despite high levels of depression (24.8%), nearly all were moderately mentally healthy (55.2%) or flourishing (43.8%). Participants agreed yoga improved: energy (84.5%), happiness (86.5%), social relationships (67%), sleep (68.5%), and weight (57.3%), and beliefs did not differ substantially according to race or gender. The more they practiced yoga, whether in years or in amount of class or home practice, the higher their odds of believing yoga improved their health. Conclusions: Individuals who practice yoga are not free of health concerns, but most believe their health improved because of yoga. Yoga might be beneficial for a number of populations including elderly women and those with chronic health conditions. © 2013.",0,0,0,1
"Ambient assistive technology considered harmful. Ambient assistive technology (AAT) is envisioned as a powerful tool for facing the growing demands the demographic change toward an aging society puts on care. While AAT is often expected to increase the quality of life of older people, this paper holds that relevant interventions often embody values that can contradict such visions, and in some cases even be harmful to care receivers. We argue that the strong focus AAT puts on illness and risk management reflects a medical model of care, which often disregards the psychosocial challenges that impairments and disabilities associated with old age can rise. We suggest that design of AAT could benefit from using the social model of care as design inspiration and value foundation. Such an approach puts focus on the person rather than the illness. The paper ends by providing a short description of work in which the social model of care is adopted as a basis for design of AAT. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",0,0,0,0
"Towards an acceptance model for AAL. As one of the major goals in the ambient assisted living project Casa Vecchia (performed in 20 real world household installations) we want to thoroughly evaluate the life circumstances of elderly people in order to be able to establish a basic ontology including all relevant factors that are actually or potentially influencing the acceptance of AAL technology. A prototype system enabling the participants to observe automated features of an AAL system as well as to perform basic interaction and communication tasks was installed. Periodic evaluation cycles that were accompanying the project which were based on a customized mix of methods and concepts frequently discussed and applied in the context of AAL research. The main concepts used are the technology acceptance model (TAM), contextual design and the analysis of social networks. The project is still up and running, but first results could already be achieved which show a different access to technology between men and women. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",1,0,0,0
"Examining social media use among older adults. Social media is a powerful tool that can connect family and friends across long distances as well as link people with similar interests. Social media has been widely adopted by younger adults, but older adults have been less likely to use such applications. A survey of 142 older adults (Mage=72 years, SD=11; range: 52-92) living in the metropolitan Atlanta area was conducted to understand the characteristics of older adults who do and do not use Facebook, a popular and wide-spread social media application. The present study examined the relationship between Facebook use and loneliness, social satisfaction, and confidence with technology. Demographic relationships were also examined, such as gender and age. Fifty-nine participants (42%) identified themselves as current Facebook users; 83 participants (58%) were not Facebook users. Non-Facebook users were significantly older (Mage= 75.3 years) than Facebook users (Mage= 66.5 years). Counter to expectations, there was not a significant difference in loneliness between Facebook users and non-users for this sample. However, Facebook users did score higher on assessments of social satisfaction and confidence with technology than did nonusers. These preliminary results suggest that many older adults do use Facebook and they primarily use it to stay connected with family. As adults enter into older adulthood, maintaining social connectedness may become more difficult due to mobility limitations, chronic diseases, and other age-related issues, thus decreasing physical connectedness with friends, family, and community. For these reasons, social media may begin to play a more active role in keeping this population socially connected. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence social media use in older adults is becoming more critical. Copyright 2013 ACM.",0,0,0,0
"Assessing the transportation needs of low-mobility individuals: Case study of a small urban community in Utah. Older adults, low-income individuals, and individuals with disabilities are generally considered ""low-mobility"" individuals, having less access to transportation options and often marginalized in the social environment of the community. This study assessed the transportation needs of low-mobility individuals using three dimensions: (1) travel characteristics, (2) social strength in terms of transportation assistance received from their social networks, and (3) accessibility to public transportation. A mixed survey method combining an in-person interview at the collaborating organizations and a mail-back survey were used. Results showed that older adults remain mobile and make more frequent short trips. The results also showed a much higher reliance on private vehicles among older adults and individuals with low income, whereas a much higher reliance on public transportation and much lower reliance on private transportation was found among individuals with disabilities. Individuals with disabilities were still active, as almost half of them travel to work frequently. However, the number of nonwork trips made by individuals with disabilities was significantly low. These findings indicated a positive relationship between transportation mode choices and social dependence with family and friends. Individuals with stronger family social ties were more likely to receive adequate help meeting their transportation needs. The accessibility analysis revealed that low-mobility individuals in Cache County, Utah, have difficulties accessing transit due to the long walking distances from their residences. These findings may be used to guide policy for improving public transportation and paratransit services to meet low-mobility individuals' needs. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",0,0,0,0
"An evaluation of older adults use of ipads in eleven UK care-homes. The introduction of the iPad and similar form-factor devices (e.g. Samsung Galaxy Tab, Asus Eee Pad and Motorola Xoom) has provided a unique opportunity for older adults to engage with mobile computing devices and platforms. Engagement with 'traditional' computing devices amongst older adults, including arguably mobile devices, such as laptop computers is low due to dexterity issues amongst this population (Hertzum & Hornbaek, 2010). Whilst the iPad removes some of the traditional barriers to computer engagement, new barriers including weight and screen reflection are evident to an older user group. This paper provides an exploratory evaluation of how older adults in 11 UK care-home settings and the staff engaged in their care are using iPads to help improve communication, build physical social networks amongst residents, staff and family members, and map the most frequently used applications by an older population during a six-month pilot period. Results suggest that applications involving information searching for personally related and historical information were most valued by older adults. Further, older adults and care staff alike report mainly positive experiences of iPad use in care settings including the increased opportunities for social interaction and the enhancement of intergenerational communication. Additionally, the barriers to use (e.g. device weight) are often overcome by low-tech adaptations and adjustment when using the device. This paper argues that the portability and adaptive nature of the iPad combined with the increased social interaction afforded by device could increase quality of life in care settings.

"Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire. Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",0,0,0,1
"The influence of the family on prevalence and morbidity of geriatric depression among elderly gopd attendees at UPTH. The study was done to determine the influence of the family on the prevalence of geriatric depression among the General Outpatient Department of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH) attendees. This was done against the background of the family being the most important influence on health and disease outcomes. Conversely, the family is the first to be affected when any member of the family falls ill. A descriptive cross-sectional study of one hundred and fifty randomly selected elderly patients attending the GOPD was carried out. A structured questionnaire containing the geriatric depression scale and the family questionnaire was administered to the patients that had satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data was entered into the computer using the Epi-Info Version 3.2.2 Software and analysed. Lack of family and social support, marital disharmony, parents living with their children and feeling of not mattering by the elderly were among the family attributes that were associated with depression. Living alone was not a risk factor. It was also found that the family had a significant role to play in the prevalence and morbidity of depression in the respondents. Likewise, the care of depressed patients took a toll on the family caregivers making them react adversely thereby worsening the condition of the recipients of care. © Medwell Journals, 2013.",1,0,0,0
"Campaign-Related Social Networking and the Political Participation of College Students. College students politically participate through traditional mechanisms at lower rates than their elders. Yet, members of this group may participate by other means, like friending candidates and joining political groups through social networking websites. We argue that these online activities serve as a meaningful form of civic engagement by broadening who participates and encouraging other forms of participation. Using a survey of randomly chosen undergraduates at a large Midwestern university, we discover that important distinctions exist between those who friend or join these online social networks and those who participate in more traditional off-line political activities. While interest in politics is a precursor to off-line engagement, it does not predict friending or joining an online social network that is political in nature.

This paper examines the employment and recruitment of immigrant care workers in the older adult care sector in Canada, based on data from interviews with 77 workers and 24 employers in care settings, as well as from 149 online employer surveys conducted in 2007-08. We find that workers enter this sector largely through social networks. Although recruitment agencies do not play a critical role in the employment and recruitment of immigrant workers, regulation could prevent instances of abuse we found. Our findings also suggest that immigration admission policies could be better aligned with Canada's needs for older adult care.",0,0,0,0
"Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older. Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",0,0,0,1
"Cultural influences on Facebook photographs. Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform. The authors would like to thank Gina Bufton, Hsu-Wen Huang, and Mitch Meltzer for the contributions to the material collection and characteristic coding of Facebook profile photographs.

"Adult hearing screening: Health policy issues-what happens next?. Purpose: Ten percent of adults in England have some type of hearing loss and would greatly benefit from hearing aids or other forms of hearing management. However, 76% of these adults do not have hearing aids or other management. The impact of this unmet need can be substantial and has been linked to depression, social isolation, employment problems, loss of independence, and dementia. This article explores how hearing screening-universal, targeted, or opportunistic-can address prevalent, incident, and future needs for hearing services as well as better define the extent of need. Method: Adults age ≥60 years living at home in England took part in a health survey, part of which was to determine the extent of need for hearing services in this population. Survey methods included a face-to-face interview and hearing screening using pure tones as well as a self-report questionnaire on other health issues. Results: The survey highlighted additional hearing-related factors that will enable referral decisions in primary care to be made with reasonable confidence that patients will use hearing aids and benefit from them. Some relevant nonhearing factors are also reported. Conclusion: There is a growing aging population with increasing needs and expectations for hearing services. Targeted screening and triage in primary care, as well as use of advanced technologies, are discussed for the future. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.",1,0,0,1
"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital. Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users. Computer/Internet training for older adults and computer/Internet use for various purposes need to consider the significant role their social capital can play.",1,0,0,1
"The robadom project: Designing an assistive robot for older adults with mild cognitive impairment [Le projet Robadom: Conception d'un robot d'assistance pour les personnes âgées presentant des troubles cognitifs légers]. Context: The ROBADOM project is devoted to the design of a robot-based solution, a ""robot butler"", capable of providing verbal and non-verbal interactions and feedbacks for assisting daily living of older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Objective: The ROBADOM project addresses the following issues: Social context for designing social robots: 1) define the robot appearance and 2) investigate the perceptions and attitudes of the elderly toward an assistive robot at home Develop the robot's behaviors to provide natural interaction with the elderly: 1) technological solutions for an expressive robot and 2) verbal and nonverbal communication between older adults and the robot Study the issue of robot acceptance in the elderly Study the impact of robot on the elderly users Method: The design of four studies realized involves both qualitative and experimental methods. These studies were carried out in our Living Lab ""LUSAGE"".Results et discussion: Small robots with some traits between human/animal and machine were appreciated by the participants. Concerning functionalities, cognitive stimulation, reminder and object localization were positively rated. Although the parti-cipants judged an assistive robot useful, they were not yet ready to adopt it. Further, the elderly perceived some expressions of a robot differently from the younger. Thus, a robotic system should be designed tailored to the characteristics of the elderly. Finally, the issue of added valued of a robotic system in comparison to a PC was raised by our participants. Therefore, various issues (technological development, human-robot interaction, social context...) are to be explored before testing the impact of the robot at home.",1,0,0,1
"Making sense of mobile- and web-based wellness information technology: Cross-generational study. Background: A recent trend in personal health and wellness management is the development of computerized applications or information and communication technologies (ICTs) that support behavioral change, aid the management of chronic conditions, or help an individual manage their wellness and engage in a healthier lifestyle. Objective: To understand how individuals across 3 generations (young, middle-aged, and older) think about the design and use of collaborative health and wellness management technologies and what roles these could take in their lives. Methods: Face-to-face semistructured interviews, paper prototype systems, and video skits were used to assess how individuals from 3 age cohorts (young: 18-25 years; middle-aged: 35-50 years; and older: ≥65 years) conceptualize the role that health and wellness computing could take in their lives. Results: A total of 21 participants in the 3 age cohorts took part (young: n=7; middle-aged: n=7; and older: n=7). Young adults expected to be able to actively manage the presentation of their health-related information. Middle-aged adults had more nuanced expectations that reflect their engagement with work and other life activities. Older adults questioned the sharing of health information with a larger audience, although they saw the value in 1-way sharing between family members or providing aggregated information. Conclusions: Our findings inform our suggestions for improving the design of future collaborative health and wellness applications that target specific age groups. We recommend that collaborative ICT health applications targeting young adults should integrate with existing social networking sites, whereas those targeting middle-aged and older adults should support small social networks that rely on intimate personal relationships. Systems that target middle-aged adults should support episodic needs, such as time-sensitive, perhaps intermittent, goal setting. They should also have a low barrier to entry, allowing individuals who do not normally engage with the Internet to participate with the application for the specific purposes of health engagement. Collaborative ICT health applications targeting older adults should allow discreet 1-way sharing, and also support sharing of information in aggregate with others' data. These systems should also provide mechanisms to preselect recipients of different kinds of data, or to easily direct specific information to individuals in real time.",0,0,0,1
"Grey Nomads travelling in Queensland, Australia: Social and health needs. At any time of the year, and particularly in the colder months of the southern part of the Australian continent, many caravans and mobile homes can be seen on the roads of northern Australia, and Queensland, in particular. Mainly during June, July, August and September, Grey Nomads frequent the northern half of Australia, to escape the colder climate of southern Australia. The term Grey Nomad is applied to the section of the older Australian population who use their retirement years as a time to experience travel once freed from the constraints of work and family commitments. This paper draws on research conducted about the health and social needs of Grey Nomads holidaying in a Central Queensland, Australia, coastal location. Open-ended, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 20 participants. Contingency plans concerning wellness, wellbeing and medical conditions all formed a part of the Grey Nomads' daily existence while travelling. Many important and lasting friendships and social support networks were formed during the journeying and sojourning phases of the travel. Many of the Grey Nomads interviewed felt the need to keep in contact with home, even though they willingly chose to leave it, and to be 'away'. Just as the Grey Nomad cohort have concerns and solutions about their health and related issues, so too, they have concerns for social networks and family connectedness while travelling in Australia.

"From old media whore to new media troll: The online negotiation of Madonna's ageing body. On the 18 January, 2009, an online pop music fan posted over fifty outtake images from Madonna's photographic shoot for her previously released Hard Candy album. These photos produced a backlash of abuse of the then fifty-year-old Madonna from music fans and can be situated in a wider online discursive sphere of brutal and offensive critique of Madonna's ageing body and femininity in social networking sites such as Facebook, for example. While longevity, experience and wisdom ensure that Madonna continues to be meaningful to nostalgic and new audiences alike, these attributes slide out of view as the focus remains upon her body, its femininity and its ability to pass in a youth-centred popular music culture. In the wider context of a cultural, political and industry debate around the practice of releasing pre-and post-airbrushed images, the leaked photos are instrumental (albeit unintentionally) for interrogating the relationship between media and authentic ageing female bodies. This article offers a theoretical analysis of the online discursive (textual and visual) poaching and negotiation of Madonna's image, celebrity and marketing of the ageing female body. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0,0,0,0
"Keeping silver surfers on the crest of a wave - Older people's ICT learning and support needs. Purpose - There is recognition that digital ICTs have the potential to support older people to live independently, to 'age well', to promote social inclusion and to facilitate access to commercial and government services. Research conducted by the Sus-IT project under the 'New Dynamics of Ageing' Programme has focused on how to help older ICT users to remain digitally engaged given the barriers that they can face and which can quickly erode their confidence or capability. Access to appropriate learning and support resources is a key issue for sustaining older ICT users. The aim of this paper is to investigate older people's ICT learning and support needs. Design/methodology/ approach - Older people themselves have been central to the research; more than 1,000 older people have participated in this research through open workshops, established formal and informal panels and groups across the UK, and through contacts with a number of organisations working with older people. Key research users (e.g. organisations representing older people and those providing services and products to be used by older people) have also collaborated in the research in a variety of roles. Findings - Findings show that older people value very highly the benefits and independence that computer use gives them, and they are often exceptionally tenacious in trying to remain digitally connected - persisting in the face of many obstacles, and often without awareness or use of existing aids to accessibility. If disengagement begins, it is usually a gradual process, rather than a single event, and likely to result from a combination of factors - changes in physical and cognitive abilities, in support, in technology and in personal circumstances. The availability of help and support emerges as a factor of paramount importance to sustaining digital connection. Practical implications - The conceptual model of the risks of sustaining digital engagement of older people arising from the research has significant implications for both policy and practice - for instance, in relation to 'digital by default'. A user-generated strategy for provision of sustainable, community-based ICT learning and support for older people is a key output from Sus-IT. Originality/value - The issues surrounding sustaining digital inclusion in older age are multi-faceted and complex - and addressing these will have significant benefits not only for older people but also for the economy and society. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",1,0,0,1
"WE HAVEN'T TALKED IN 30 YEARS!: Relationship reconnection and internet use at midlife. The phenomenon of reconnection of dormant ties using internet communication technologies has been identified as having salience in the use of social media forms by midlife and older adults. Dormant ties, as distinguished from those that are merely inactive, are those that were once operational, but which have lapsed under the stressors of time, distance and circumstance, such as relationships between former college friends, neighbors or work colleagues. Reconnection is the process by which these dormant ties become active again, and is an activity which is supported in unique ways by internet communication technologies. This study presents findings from interviews with midlife adults on how the use of email, social network sites and search engines is leveraged to enhance and support the reconnection of dormant relationships and maintain weak ties. Grounded in a life course perspective, it examines how the experiences of longevity and the life course alter perceptions of the attributes and drawbacks that these technologies offer. By examining adults at midlife, a less-well studied group than teens and young adults, this work provides a more nuanced perspective of the technological practices at varied points in life, and offers insight on how various communication technologies might be utilized at different life stages. © 2013 Copyright Kelly Quinn.",0,0,0,0
"Social inclusion through virtual worlds. In this chapter, the theoretical foundation of the use of virtual worlds (3D environments) to strengthen the personal social network of people who are challenged in that area, especially the elderly, is described. The psychological (bordering on sociological and anthropological) aspects of ""living"" in a virtual ""world,"" such as Second Life, are described. Opportunities and threats of those aspects regarding the possibilities of strengthening the personal network and quality of life are indicated. The chapter is based on a 5-year research project. The concrete outcome of which is translated into real life projects under the name VayaV. VayaV is described in this chapter as a case study. The Dutch municipalities all agree that the main social problems facing their citizens are exclusion, feeling lonely, passivity, and lack of friends and an adequate personal social network. In the latest figures, more than a third of the people who were interviewed (a cross section of the whole Dutch population) said: I am often lonely and I am suffering because of it. With their consent, a virtual environment is developed based on the research project in Second Life, in such a way that people who do not like computers and know nothing about digital social networks can meet and have fun and form a community of friends and acquaintances. In this case, there is more to the VayaV approach than playing a game in which someone has set the rules and goals for you. It is more like everyday life where people set their own goals and rules, according to their own values and norms. © 2013 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.",0,0,0,0
"Patients' perceptions of depression and coronary heart disease: A qualitative UPBEAT-UK study. Background: The prevalence of depression in people with coronary heart disease (CHD) is high but little is known about patients' own perceptions and experiences of this. This study aimed to explore (i) primary care (PC) patients' perceptions of links between their physical condition and mental health, (ii) their experiences of living with depression and CHD and (iii) their own self-help strategies and attitudes to current PC interventions for depression. Method. Qualitative study using consecutive sampling, in-depth interviews and thematic analysis using a process of constant comparison. 30 participants from the UPBEAT-UK cohort study, with CHD and symptoms of depression. All participants were registered on the General Practitioner (GP) primary care, coronary register. Results: A personal and social story of loss underpinned participants' accounts of their lives, both before and after their experience of having CHD. This theme included two interrelated domains: interpersonal loss and loss centred upon health/control issues. Strong links were made between CHD and depression by men who felt emasculated by CHD. Weaker links were made by participants who had experienced distressing life events such as divorce and bereavement or were living with additional chronic health conditions (i.e. multimorbidity). Participants also felt 'depressed' by the 'medicalisation' of their lives, loneliness and the experience of ageing and ill health. Just under half the sample had consulted their GP about their low mood and participants were somewhat ambivalent about accessing primary care interventions for depression believing the GP would not be able to help them with complex health and social issues. Talking therapies and interventions providing the opportunity for social interaction, support and exercise, such as Cardiac Rehabilitation, were thought to be helpful whereas anti-depressants were not favoured. Conclusions: The experiences and needs of patients with CHD and depression are diverse and include psycho-social issues involving interpersonal and health/control losses. In view of the varying social and health needs of patients with CHD and depression the adoption of a holistic, case management approach to care is recommended together with personalised support providing the opportunity for patients to develop and achieve life and health goals, where appropriate. © 2013 Simmonds et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",0,0,0,1
"The impact of ICT services on perceptions of the quality of life of older people. The aim of this paper is to report results of the impact of the information and communication technology (ICT) platform and telecare services developed by the MonAMI consortium on the quality of life (QOL) of older people in three European communities. In a three-month trial, the MonAMI technology was installed in the homes of older people with various needs, in the cities of Stockholm, Sweden; Zaragoza, Spain; and Kosice, Slovakia. Evaluation criteria and instrumentation were developed to assess the effects of the services on users' perceived QOL in the domains of independence, physical health, psychological wellbeing, social networking, and physical environment. A total of 62 users, with a mean age of 79 years, participated in the trial. Results demonstrate that the MonAMI services had some positive, significant effects on users' QOL. For instance, users with a higher number of disabilities at baseline reported greater confidence in keeping intruders from entering their home compared to users with fewer disabilities (OR=2.51, 0.01 p<0.05). However, overall findings show that healthier, more independent users perceived more benefits from the services compared to users who report more health problems and are less independent. The complexities of conducting the MonAMI trial led to a small, heterogeneous sample of users over a short time span. This in turn created difficulties in observing the potential effects of the services and achieving significance on some indicators of QOL. This paper provides quantitative analyses around the impact of telecare services; suggests important directions for further research; and highlights the methodological challenges of evaluating ICT-based care services in a community setting. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

"Gender differences in motivations to practice physical activity and sport in old age [Diferencias de género en las motivaciones para practicar actividades físico-deportivas en la vejez]. The aim of this study is to analyze possible gender differences in motivations to practice physical activity and sport in old age. The methodology was based in computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI), using a structured questionnaire, to a randomly selected sample of the elderly Spanish population (800, 440 women and 360 men between 65 and 79 years old). Older women and men combine extrinsic motivations, such improving and maintaining physical fitness related to health (62,1% women, 60% men) and intrinsic motivations, as pleasure felt by the activity (33,3% women, 32% men). The motives related to social relationships, like fun, leisure time occupation and medical advice have a greater influence on women than men while men refer to the importance of previous practice on the current practice. The findings suggest that programs to promote physical activity and sport in older adults should consider these differences.",1,0,0,0

"The Transnational Ties that Bind: Relationship Considerations for Graduating International Science and Engineering Research Students. The last decade has witnessed a significant rise in scholarly and policy attention paid to the migration and career decisions of international (post)graduate research students, particularly those in science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines. Considered by many governments as important contributors to national science and innovation agendas, as well as potential members of an educated labour force, several states have implemented strategic regulatory changes to encourage foreign (post)graduate students in these fields to remain after their studies. However, these policies tend to frame such students as free agents able to respond to easing work permit or residency conditions in line with their individual career or lifestyle preferences. This paper advances theorisations of post-graduation decision making among international students by illustrating the extent to which diverse transnational social ties and personal concerns are highly influential in shaping migration and career strategies. Drawing on in-depth interviews with foreign students completing science and engineering (post)graduate degrees in London, UK and Toronto, Canada, the paper demonstrates that relationship considerations, such as care for ageing parents, managing dual careers, and future childcare and work-life balance concerns, are tightly intermingled with graduates' different employment and settlement considerations at this transitional life-stage. These findings carry wider implications for our understanding of the multiple geographic directions in which students feel pulled upon graduation - challenging traditional push-pull or stay-or-return portrayals. They also underscore the importance of accommodating social reproduction concerns for the production and circulation of a scientific labour force. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",0,0,0,0
"Influence of multisystemic affection on health-related quality of life in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1. Aim: To assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with DM1, to identify muscular, multisystemic, central and social factors that may affect QoL and to define a DM1 patient in risk of poor QoL. Patients and method: This cross-sectional study comprised 120 DM1 consecutive patients. The following scales were used: Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Muscular Impairment Rating Scale (MIRS), battery of neuropsychological tests, acceptance of illness scale (AIS), Hamilton rating scale for depression (Ham-D), Krupp's Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Daytime Sleepiness Scale (DSS) and SF-36 questionnaire. Results: HRQoL was impaired in DM1 patients in both physical and mental domains (PCS was 41.8 ± 23.5, MCS 47.0 ± 24.3 and total SF-36 score 45.6 ± 24.0). The most significant factors correlating with better SF-36 total score were younger age (β = -0.45, p &lt; 0.001), shorter duration of disease (β = -0.27, p = 0.001), higher education (β = 0.20, p = 0.009), less severe muscular weakness (β = -0.52, p &lt; 0.001), normal swallowing (β = 0.22, p = 0.005), absence of fainting (β = 0.31, p = 0.002), absence of snoring (β = 0.21, p = 0.036), better acceptance of disease (β = -0.17, p = 0.036), lower depressiveness (β = -0.46, p = 0.001), lower fatigue (β = -0.32, p = 0.001), absence of cataract (β = -0.21, p = 0.034), absence of kyphosis (β = 0.31, p = 0.004) and absence of constipation (β = 0.24, p = 0.016). Second linear regression analysis revealed that depressed (β = -0.38, p &lt; 0.001) and elder patients (β = -0.27, p = 0.007) and as well as those with poor acceptance of illness (β = -0.21, p = 0.006) were in especially higher risk of having poor HRQoL (R2 = 0.68). Conclusion: We identified different central, social, muscular, cardiorespiratory and other factors correlating with HRQoL. It is of great importance that most of these factors are amenable to treatment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",0,0,0,1
"Usability of tablet computers by people with early-stage dementia. Background: Tablet computers are generally associated with an intuitive interface. The adoption and use of tablet computers within the early-stage dementia context could potentially assist in daily living and provide users with a source for leisure activities and social networking. As dementia mainly affects the older adult population, it is expected that many people with dementia and even their carers do not use tablet computers as part of their everyday living. Objective: This paper explores the usability of tablet computers within the early-stage dementia context as a source of leisure for people with dementia. The main advantage of the use of tablet computers in this manner is to provide carers some reprieve from the constant care and attention often required in caring for people with dementia. Methods: Seven-day in-home trials were conducted to determine whether people with early-stage dementia were -capable of using a tablet computer independently. Twenty-one people with early-stage dementia and carer dyads participated in the trial. Feedback was gathered through questionnaires from both the person with dementia and their carer regarding the use of a tablet computer as part of their everyday living. Results: Approximately half the participants with dementia were able to engage with and use the tablet computer independently, which proved to be helpful to their carers. No significant traits were observed to help identify those who were less likely to use a tablet computer. Carer relief was quantified by the amount of time participants with dementia spent using the device without supervision. Conclusions: The results and feedback from the trial provide significant insights to introducing new technology within the early-stage dementia context. Users' needs must be considered on a case-by-case basis to successfully facilitate the uptake of tablet computers in the dementia context. The trial has provided sufficient justification to further explore more uses of tablet computers in the dementia context, and not just for early-stage dementia. Copyright © 2012 S.

"Designing icanfit: A mobile-enabled web application to promote physical activity for older cancer survivors. Background: Most older cancer survivors (OCS) do not engage in regular physical activity (PA) despite well-known health benefits. With the increased use of mobile technologies among older adults, mobile tools may be an effective method to deliver PA promotion programs for OCS. Objective: To document the process of designing an OCS-friendly mobile-enabled Web application of PA promotion program. Methods: Mixed methods encompassing group discussions, individual interviews, and brief surveys with community leaders, OCS, cancer care providers, and software professionals were used in this formative research. Results: The varied stakeholders welcomed the idea of developing an online tool to promote PA in OCS. Our formative research revealed several major barriers to regular PA including limited access to senior-friendly PA resources, lack of motivation and social support, and insufficient knowledge and skills on building safe and appropriate workout plans. This feedback was incorporated into the development of iCanFit, a mobile-enabled Web application, designed specifically for OCS. The iCanFit online tools allow users to locate PA resources, set and track goals for PA, network with peer OCS in a secure online space, and receive practical and evidence-informed healthy tips. Conclusions: Our mixed-method formative research led to the design of iCanFit protocol to promote PA and well-being of OCS. The involvement of stakeholders is critical in the planning and design of the mobile application in order to enhance program relevance, appeal, and match with the needs of target users.",0,0,0,1
"A smart workspace supporting a healthy life in pre-elderly households. In development of ageing-friendly environments, the evolving social and technical requirements of the elderly have often not been adequately taken into account. A more in-depth understanding of the needs, preferences and social and technical dispositions of the pre-elderly (late 40s and 50s) would provide an enhanced perspective regarding the usability of smart environments. The pre-elderly would have different characteristics from those who are elderly at present. They are more skilled than the present-day elderly at using information technologies such as email, social networking services and smart phones. As they continue to age, the pre-elderly will need environments equipped with smart technologies for use in self-development and professional work. This is especially the case, as it is anticipated that the elderly of the future will have high levels of health and activity. This study involved intensive interviews with several double-income couples in their 40s. The couples' future desires and requirements for enabling technologies and smart home workspaces were identified. A conceptual framework for a smart workspace was developed based on a first interview with each participating couple. This framework was verified by feedback derived from a second interview. In conclusion, a direction for the design of a smart workspace was proposed. © 2012 The Author(s).",0,0,0,0
"E-health and digital inclusion. E-health resources can deliver demonstrable benefits for quality of care, for example through provision of public health information and access to online communities and self-help groups for those experiencing ill-health. Digitally excluded groups of health consumers such as older people and those with disabilities have much to gain from the social connectedness and social support offered through these digitally facilitated resources - yet at the same time are most vulnerable to continued exclusion due to inappropriate technology design and implementation. In this chapter, we describe in detail the opportunities e-health can offer in the context of digital inclusion by reducing social exclusion and enhancing quality of life through thoughtful technology intervention. We highlight the problems that may emerge or persist if the design of e-health systems does not fully take into account the challenges of user access and adoption. We show how principles of user-centred and inclusive design can be used as a basis on which successful e-health systems can be developed and implemented and offer suggestions for how these principles can best influence design of future systems. © 2013 by IGI Global.

"Obstacles to social networking website use among older adults. Social networking websites (SNSs) have become popular among younger adults, but internet-using older adults have not adopted this communication medium nearly as quickly (Lenhart, 2009; Madden, 2010). This study seeks to understand what factors encourage or discourage older adults from using SNS, like Facebook, to help understand what may be done to ensure both generations have communication media over which they enjoy and feel comfortable communicating. Using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM; Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989) as a framework, 124 internet-using older adults aged 60-90, completed attitudinal measures of perceived usefulness of SNS, perceived ease of use of websites, social pressures to use SNS, and trust in SNS, as well as behavioral measures of current internet use, SNS use, and intention to use SNS in the future. Regression analyses revealed significant predictors of SNS include perceived usefulness, trust in SNS, and frequency of internet use. Unexpectedly, factors of ease of use and social pressures were not significant predictors. Implications for the TAM and for individuals with an interest in getting older adults to use SNS are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",1,0,0,0
"Enhancing social interaction between older adults and their families. The rise of Internet and ubiquitous technologies have spread and diversified the social media used by people to interact among them. Unfortunately most older adults are not able to use these solutions. This situation isolates them and negatively affects their physical and mental health. Aiming to improve mood in older adults, and helping them overcome the negative effects of social isolation, we have developed a computer-based intermediary system, that we called Social Connector. This system is capable of boosting the social interaction between an elder and his/her close relatives; e.g. adult children and grandchildren. The system can also be used as a sensor of elders' social interactions and mood. The preliminary evaluation results indicate that the system is well accepted by older adults, and it can be used to boost social interactions with their relatives. © Springer International Publishing 2013.",1,0,0,0
"Ambient awareness to strengthen the family social network of older adults. Social networking sites (SNSs) provide ambient awareness of the interests and activities of friends and relatives helping them sustain and strengthen their social ties. Older adults who are not adopting SNSs might however feel like outsiders within their own families who increasingly rely on these services to socialize. Previous research has shown that situated displays can provide appropriate interfaces for older adults to use digital services. In this paper we explore how situated displays can intuitively provide ambient awareness to strengthen the family social network of older adults. We designed and developed Tlatoque, a situated display, to seamlessly integrate older adults into the SNS used by their relatives. The results of a 21-week deployment study of an initial version of Tlatoque in one extended family showed that the older adult became more conscious of relatives' activities, which also enriched in-person encounters. However, relatives expected the older adult to reply to their posts in the SNS and Tlatoque lacked mechanisms for the older adult to provide feedback. We re-designed Tlatoque to incorporate means for enabling the older adult to share information back to the SNS. We conducted a second 21-week deployment study with another extended family to evaluate the use of this new version of the system. Our results indicate that the second design was successful in providing ambient awareness to the older adult as well as to her relatives. We conclude that situated displays that provide SNS services can assist the integration of older adults to their social network and contribute to enhance asymmetric relations between the older adult and younger relatives. © 2012 Springer.",1,1,1,0
"Connecting Older Adults to the Community Through Multimedia: An Intergenerational Reminiscence Program. Reminiscence programs are believed to be beneficial for older adults; however, benefits may not be exclusively related to reminiscing but to group process. A reminiscence program for older adults aimed at intergenerational connection through multimedia is reported. This evaluation utilized three sources of data: participant's stories, focus groups conducted with group members, and responses from social networking websites along with blog readers. Overall, results show that participants benefited from the program by having a vehicle to tell their story and an activity that fulfilled social needs. Additionally, community members benefited from and learned about participants in a way that utilized efficient modes of communication and media. Findings support the intergenerationality of this program in that it was able to connect older adults with younger generations both in person and virtually. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1,1,1,0
"Providing access to Social Networking Services for elderly people. The aim of the Ambient Assisted Living Project Social Interaction Screen is to support social interaction of elderly people by easing access to existing Social Networking Services. In this paper, we present the solution that was developed in the project, the elderly interaction and service assistant (elisa). We discuss the design of the prototype and present first results of its evaluation in Germany and Spain. In general, the results showed that elderly participants with different social activeness and technical affinity enjoyed the social interaction with family and friends through a user-oriented tablet interface. Nevertheless, we were unable to convince members of social networks to share their activity streams due to privacy concerns. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",1,1,1,1
"Online social networking in older individuals: A study of hertfordshire. The penetration rate of Online Social Networks (OSNs) within older individuals of society is still not as large as within the younger generation. Using this as motivation this research aimed to identify and understand the adoption, use and diffusion of OSNs within UK's older population. For this purpose, a conceptual framework was formed that was then empirically determined using the older individuals demographic group of society Findings revealed that of the overall sample of 1080 participants aged 50 and over 51.9% did not use OSNs. It was also found that older individuals would adopt Internet technologies if technology facilitating conditions such as 'anytime access' to Internet capable devices and a fast reliable Internet connection had significant positive effects on OSN intentions. In terms of influences of peers, it was revealed that older individuals do consider and act upon the views of members in one's social circle. Contributions for academia include empirical findings of a model for OSNs specific to a demographic group of society. For industry this study identifies specific factors of consideration for the wider penetration of OSNs in UK's older population. Policymakers can also identify factors that will influence older people to adopt and use OSNs.",0,0,0,0
Enriching in-person encounters through social media: A study on family connectedness for the elderly. Social media sites have become immensely popular. In 2010 it was estimated that Americans spent a quarter of their online time using social networking sites (SNSs) and blogs. Prior studies have shown how people spend more time socializing through digital communication services such as SNSs reducing face- to-face interaction. Individuals limited offline interactions cause a sense of self-perception of being less socially involved. In this paper we explore how the use of an ubiquitous system we developed. Tlatoque is able to adapt and move the SNS's social capital outside the desktop into a domestic setting to support older adults' off line interactions with their family. The findings of a 21 week deployment study uncovered the offline practices surrounding the use of Tlatoque and its social implications toward the existing family ties (n = 30). Results qualitatively indicate that the content shared in SNSs strengthens older adults' social network by enriching and complementing traditional social engagements such as those conducted over the phone or in-person. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.,1,1,1,0
"Probing the audience of seniors' online communities. Objectives. Participation in online communities that are dedicated to older adults is a significant trend in elders' use of the Internet. The present study aimed to explore the audience of these communities and to discover possible subsegments within that audience and the differences among them.Methods. The study was based on an online survey of 218 members of 16 English language-based seniors' online communities.Results. Analysis demonstrated that the audience of the communities is not homogeneous, as 3 segments of community members were identified: information swappers, aging-oriented, and socializers. These groups differed in their interests, background characteristics, and participation patterns. In addition, results indicated significant differences between the groups in perceived benefits. The socializers were those who reported the highest level of gratification. The aging-oriented reported more ""companionship"" than the information swappers, and the latter reported more ""joyfulness"" than the aging-oriented.Conclusions. The results suggested that members of seniors' online communities actively select community contents that best meet their psychosocial needs and use the communities interchangeably with other media and activities. Such purposeful use of the communities becomes an integral part of the strategies they utilize in order to cope with later life circumstances. © 2013 © The Author 2013.

"Psychosocial service use and unmet need among recently diagnosed adolescent and young adult cancer patients. Background: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer demonstrate biomedical risks and psychosocial issues distinct from those of children or older adults. In this study, the authors examined and compared the extent to which AYAs treated in pediatric or adult oncology settings reported use of, and unmet need for, psychosocial support services. Methods: Within 4 months of initial cancer diagnosis, 215 AYAs ages 14 to 39 years (99 from pediatric care settings and 116 from adult care settings; 75% response rate) were assessed for reporting use of information resources, emotional support services, and practical support services. Statistical analyses derived odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for service use and unmet needs after controlling for race, employment/school status, sex, relationship status, severity of cancer, treatment, and treatment-related side effects. Results: AYAs ages 20 to 29 years were significantly less likely than teens and older patients ages 30 to 39 years to report using professional mental health services and were significantly more likely to report an unmet need with regard to cancer information, infertility information, and diet/nutrition information. Compared with teens who were treated in pediatric facilities, AYAs who were treated in adult facilities were more likely to report an unmet need for age-appropriate Internet sites, professional mental health services, camp/retreats programs, transportation assistance, and complementary and alternative health services. Conclusions: Substantial proportions of AYAs are not getting their psychosocial care needs met. Bolstering psychosocial support staff and patient referral to community-based social service agencies and reputable Internet resources may enhance care and improve quality of life for AYAs. © 2012 American Cancer Society.",0,0,0,1

"Digital literacy in Spain as a means of social inclusion: Implementation of a measurement model using indicators [La alfabetización digital en España como medio de inclusión social: Aplicación de un modelo de medición a través de indicadores]. Through the application of the measurement model developed in the project IMPOLIS, an analysis of data on the impact of ICT policies established in relation to issues of social inclusion is proposed. The IMPOLIS research project aims to develop a model for measuring the impact of ICT policies, that can be employed to guide efficient decision making for harmonious and sustainable development of the Knowledge Society. In this research the regions with the lowest GDP per capita in the Spanish territory were selected, in relation to the matters specified in the project on the effectiveness of ICT policies, and a representative sample of the target groups (women, elderly, unemployed, disabled, people suffering from illiteracy, immigrants) by geographical areas. The scorecard indicators ( scoreboard ) for the model focuses on three categories or dimensions of study, Social Infrastructure ICT Competence and Level Appropriation Competence, in turn divided into several sub-categories of analysis. The results obtained in this study allow a first checking of the validity of the proposed measurement proposed by the IMPLOLIS Project, as a monitoring tool for ICT policies. The proposed method allows to design and redirect measures for reducing the digital divide, and to consolidate a model of social inclusion through digital inclusion in line with current EU measures.",0,0,0,0
"Towards social inclusion of elder people using smart systems. In the rapidly ageing world, evolving information and communication technologies are both welcomed as useful tools and also criticized as an important reason for social exclusion. This is because of the difficulty to retrieve required information and services from the volume of information and plethora of services available on the Web. So it is needed to develop Smart Systems that will provide required information that is easily accessible to elder people with varying capacities and resources. The central concern is to have Smart systems to foster active ageing by staying connected with events, people and getting timely, practical information to manage life and meet personal needs. This paper provides the design of a RESTful Smart System composed of different web services according to the requirement which will give assistance to the elder citizens in their daily life. To achieve a user friendly and easily accessible interface for the elder citizens the Hypermedia control defined in REST paradigm is also analyzed which provides the way to drive the users from one state to another through links.",0,0,0,0
"HIV- and AIDS-related stigma: Psychosocial aspects in a representative Spanish sample. This study evaluates the prevalence of HIV stigma in Spain and analyzes some variables that may affect its existence. In 2008, we conducted a computer-assisted telephone survey of 1607 people, representative of the Spanish population. Two-wave random stratified sampling was performed, first selecting the home and then the person, depending on the rates of age and sex. About 50% of the population feels discomfort about potential contact with people with HIV and tries to avoid it and 20% advocate discriminatory policies involving physical or social segregation of people with HIV. The belief that HIV is easily transmitted through social contact (15%) and blaming people with HIV for their disease (19.3%) are associated with stigmatization. Degree of proximity to people with HIV, political ideology, educational level, and age are also associated with the degree of stigmatization. According to these results, we suggest that, in order to reduce stigma, we need to modify the erroneous beliefs about the transmission pathways, decrease attributions of blame to people with HIV, and increase contact with them. These interventions should particularly target older people, people with a low educational level, and people with a more conservative political ideology.

"Gendered adaptive preferences, autonomy, and end of life decisions. Other essays in this volume focus on how we may adapt our preferences to available health opportunities. In the late stages of a terminal illness, we may come to underestimate the desirability of a high-functioning life. Increases in the availability of life-extending technology may make it difficult to perceive value in the normal experience of aging. However, health opportunities are not the only circumstantial factors that stand to influence our end of life choices. End of life decisions call up questions about what we believe death is, how we want others to see us, and what we think we deserve from them – among other deep questions about value. Biological limitations and the availability of medical technologies are not the only types of external factors that influence our views about these questions of value. Our individual answers to such questions are related to the religious views to which we have been exposed, the strength of our familial and social ties, the occupational and other life opportunities that our society has made available to us, and the views our society has promoted about our worth and the worth of people like us. A lifetime of social limitations (and/or opportunities) has shaped the perspective from which any of us decides whether to pursue lifeprolonging treatment, palliative care, or death. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",0,0,0,0
"Stay in touch: Multimedia delivery for elderly people. The world has seen an increasing number of elderly people living alone with some mental and emotional complications as the ageing population increases worldwide. The elderly people have a greater risk for loneliness, depression, and decreased mobility than any other age group. A proper health and social care environment is needed for them to become more accustomed to living alone. Partially due to retirement and physical limitation, most of them become less involved with other people and have less mobility away from their homes. Spending most of their time at homes and watching televisions is unavoidable. There are increasingly fewer family members who live with elderly people full-time. Contacting to relatives and old friends becomes more difficult, and so does using phones and computers even though they are readily available. We propose a simple but effective system to deliver multimedia to the elderly people in order to help them stay in touch with family members, relatives and friends, and consequently lessen the aforementioned problems. The multimedia's contents are sent via the Internet from family members' and friends' devices such as smartphones and tablet PCs to the elderly people's television sets. It is intended to improve the mental disposition of the ageing population and to give them a sense of social belonging and active societal engagement, hopefully resulting in a better quality of life. © 2013 IEEE.",0,0,0,0
"Nutrition in the elderly. The elderly population is growing with time in the developed as well as in the developing societies at a rate of about 5% a year. This population has higher morbidity then the general population. The elderly are characterized by changes in different physiological activities as well as multiple pathologies. Cellular function is based on hormones, cytokines and neurotransmitters acting through the cell's receptors and altered cellular function. Dietary structure is considered as one of the components of health and well-being. Having a high morbidity together with a slower rate of cure, elderly are major consumers of nutrition support. It is important to differentiate between the role of nutrition as part of lifestyle, in aging and the role of nutrition in treatment of the sick elderly. Nutrition has an important role in the process of healthy aging, nevertheless aging has an impact on the nutrition of the person secondary to physiological changes. The recent developments in the technology of nutrition support give us the tools to supply every person with all nutrient compounds in different manners. We can modulate the dietary structure in any way that we think that can benefit the person. There are enriched solutions with different substances, that either bypass the swallowing mechanism in different ways supplying enteral nutrition or going parenterally directly to the circulation through different ports. Despite these various opportunities there are many questions about the efficacy of nutritional support in the elderly in certain conditions and an ethical debate regarding the indication with different opinions is current, questioning the medical indications, together with the techniques and the timing for the implementation of such support. Sarcopenia, a decline in muscle mass, is part of the aging process. The differentiation between low muscular mass resulting from disease-related starvation and that derived from different responses to disease consequent to the background effect of aging has has been recently determined. The role of the feeding process as part of the needs of the old person, reflecting empathy and psychosocial support, is becoming a more prominent part of the care of the elderly. Currently, the main challenge of clinical nutrition in the aged, is in the determination of the optimal time for intervention. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.",0,0,0,0
"Communication between the elderly person and the Family Health Team: Is there integrality?. Objective: to verify the forms of communication used in four Primary Health Units with Family Health Program teams in Porto Feliz, São Paulo, and how they impact in the care and control of the health of elderly people. Method: this qualitative study sought to capture the communication between elderly people and healthcare professionals. Interviews were conducted with 20 elderly people of both sexes. Results: from the discourses and observations, assertive communication and blocked communication emerged as the central analysis themes, the verbal and nonverbal elements of which, unveiled subjectivity of the communication process, of the local culture and of the psychosocial factors positively and negatively contributing to the healthcare for elderly people. The nursing teams of the Family Health Strategy showed forms of communication that favored the adherence of the elderly people to the care and control of their health. Negatives aspects did not have completely prejudicial consequences, however, should be avoided, in order to facilitate integral care to elderly people. Conclusion: it is worth reinforcing the need for improvement of the nursing team and other healthcare professionals regarding health communication as an innovative technology, bringing credibility to the health promotion and prevention programs with elderly users.",1,0,0,1
"Age management concept - opportunity or threat. As human age prolongs, also the retirement age limit of employees moves. Today sixty-year-old person - if not affected by any serious health handicap - is still a person full of energy, power and, yet, mature and experienced enough to handle regular work tasks as well as unpredictable situations not possible to manage only by a routine approach. (Jenšík, 2013) Currently, the Age Management Concept, i.e. personnel management considering age and changing skills of employees within organisation, starts to be applied and implemented to some extent within the human resources management area. Thus, the organisation management, within this concept, should approach to every single employee differently, understand their individual needs, support their continuous growth or development, and, on the other hand, accept their limits or weaknesses. These weaknesses should be minimised or removed completely in the employee - organisation management mutual synergy. It is, thus, obvious that each employee shall have other positives and other negatives not only regarding the gender, work performance or position, but also with regard to the biological age. In this context, Vortelová (2013) presents the research of Manpower conducted in 2007 and focused on individual generations of employees from the perspective of social categories for the area of human resources management. It involves five generations of employees in total where one generation is limited by the duration approximately of 15 years. It concerns the generation of Pre- Boomers: employees born before 1946, and further the generation of Baby Boomers: employees born within the years from 1947 to 1960. The third generation is the X Generation: employees born during the years from 1961 to 1975. Typical for this generation is that the people are willing to work hard, they have distinctive individualistic features, money means value for them, and they strive not to run into debts, they make clear decisions between their family and career, and have rather pessimistic view of the world. The third generation is called Y Generation: employees born during the years from 1976 to 1990. This generation only sees money as a mean and willingly run into debts, requires good remuneration for work, willingly changes working places and, usually, does not seek any sense in the job, and requires more flexible working hours. The fifth generation is indicated as Z Generation: employees born during the years from 1991 to 2005. This youngest generation is highly interconnected and globalised, is constantly online, and uses advanced means of communication and technology. Pillinger (2008) or Polčáková (2011) define the Age Management Concept as a complex approach leading to the solution of demographic changes at the work place, supporting age diversity and management of work processes within the physical and social environment. The article offers a view to some of the partial results of quantitative and qualitative research conducted within the author's doctoral thesis focused on specific aspects of personnel management of employees of the age category 50+ in conditions of Czech and Slovak organisations and, further, of TACR (Technology Agency of the Czech Republic) grant project, OMEGA Programme to support applied social-science research and experimental development, registration No. TD010129, Performance Potential of Employees 50+, and specific forms of companies' human resources management. The main purpose of the article is to initiate discussion over the Age Management Concept or philosophy itself. Does, therefore, the personnel management considering the age and changing skills of organisation employees mean an opportunity or, on the contrary, a threat for the complex operation of the whole organisation?.",0,0,0,0

"Older adults and their internet behaviors. Early research on older adult computer users focused on the possibility for technology to increase social interaction and alleviate loneliness. Subsequent research has been equivocal on the possible benefits of the Internet for well-being. Nonetheless, in spite of an initial ""gray gap,"" older adults are increasingly joining younger cohorts in using the Internet. Barriers to older adults' use of the Internet remain, such as physical and cognitive limitations. Attitudinal barriers may exist, but it is unclear whether these result from lack of experience or differences in income or health status. Business researchers have found that older persons differ from other age groups in their Internet engagement patterns, including online buying. Future research directions include whether computers can improve cognitive functioning and quality of life, how to increase engagement levels, and if there will always be a lag in technology use among older adults. © 2012, IGI Global.",0,0,0,0
"Assessing design features of a graphical user interface for a social assistive robot for older adults with cognitive impairment. Purpose: Over the past several years, a variety of assistive technologies have been conceived and developed to support independent living and quality of life of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Within this area socially-assistive robotics is a growing field. However, although robotics has the potential to support the elderly with cognitive impairment in daily tasks, the development of usable interfaces remains a challenge. For instance, changes in perceptual and cognitive abilities should be addressed in robotics design because they affect technology use. The aim of the QuoVADis project was to develop a socially-assistive robot for elderly people with cognitive impairment. The semi-autonomous remotely controlled robot consists of a mobile platform guided by a computer and electronic system. The robot input devices include speech control and a touch-screen. The system, capable of social interaction, was specifically conceived to provide cognitive and social support to the user through a suite of applications (task reminder, cognitive training, navigation support, and communication). The purpose of this work was to develop the graphical user interface (GUI) through which these services are provided. In a previous study we defined a set of requirements that were used to design the robot's GUI. In this paper we present results from usability testing of the functional prototype of the GUI with target end-users and the modifications made to produce the final version of the applications. Method: We used a user-centred design approach for the GUI design. Eleven elderly persons with MCI and 11 elderly with normal cognition were recruited for this study. First, the moderator described the purpose of the research, introduced the robot and explained the evaluation procedure. Then participants were asked to complete a series of tasks using the main menu of the GUI and navigate through its different applications. Performance and satisfaction measures were collected (e.g., time to complete each task, number of errors due to manipulation, number of help requests). Tests were conducted individually. Results & Discussion: Findings confirmed that most of the features of the GUI were adapted to the needs and capacities of older adults with cognitive impairment. However, individual factors (age, education level, and computer experience) were found to affect task performances. Moreover, some particular aspects of the interfaces (icons, navigation system) had to be modified to make the application usable by the largest number of patients suffering from cognitive deficits. These results were used to develop the final version of the GUI. We confirmed that designing and developing assistive technologies to support elderly with cognitive impairment requires end-user involvement throughout all the development and evaluation phases. This study is an example of a successful design process for assistive technologies to support MCI-patients and their caregivers, involving them throughout all the development phases and applying the concept of iterative evaluations.",1,0,0,1
"Actual use of computers and the internet by older adults: Potential benefits and risks. Improving autonomy and quality of life for older adults has become an increasingly important aim of gerontological research. Computer and Internet applications hold great promise to maintain autonomy and increase quality of life.

It is based on an intervention program that included concise computer training and the use of a computer and the Internet for twelve months. The results of this randomized, controlled study showed no effects, neither positive nor negative, of computer and Internet use on cognitive functioning, autonomy, well-being and social network, the use of everyday technological devices, and subjective physical functioning. Overall, it was concluded that computer and Internet usage by healthy older adults is a safe activity, albeit with no robust advantage for cognitive capacity in healthy older adults. © 2013, IGI Global.",1,1,1,0
"The role of tea parties to elicit technology requirements to support the mobility of older adults. Mobility is fundamental to aging well, maintaining independence and quality of life. Physical mobility is a fundamental component of overall mobility. This paper presents our ""technology tea party"" methodology. We have used this method to explore older adults' reaction to utilizing different technologies to maintain their mobility, in particular, games consoles to promote exercise at home. At our tea party, participants experienced problems with initially getting started with the console but with minimal support were able to interact with the system and start to explore the benefits they could gain from using such a system. They saw the benefits not only as exercise but also as promoting social interaction. We are now using this method in the design process for an ""intelligent"" walking aid to improve the ability of older adults to walk around shopping centres. In this paper we advocate the involvement of older adults throughout the design process and we present tea parties as a potential method to use in early stages to elicit requirements.",1,0,0,0
"Multimodal user interfaces to improve social integration of elderly and mobility impaired. Technologies for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Communication have evolved tremendously over the past decades. However, citizens such as mobility impaired or elderly or others, still face many difficulties interacting with communication services, either due to HCI issues or intrinsic design problems with the services. In this paper we start by presenting the results of two user studies, the first one conducted with a group of mobility impaired users, comprising paraplegic and quadriplegic individuals; and the second one with elderly. The study participants carried out a set of tasks with a multimodal (speech, touch, gesture, keyboard and mouse) and multi-platform (mobile, desktop) system, offering an integrated access to communication and entertainment services, such as email, agenda, conferencing, instant messaging and social media, referred to as LHC - Living Home Center. The system was designed to take into account the requirements captured from these users, with the objective of evaluating if the adoption of multimodal interfaces for audio-visual communication and social media services, could improve the interaction with such services. Our study revealed that a multimodal prototype system, offering natural interaction modalities, especially supporting speech and touch, can in fact improve access to the presented services, contributing to the reduction of social isolation of mobility impaired, as well as elderly, and improving their digital inclusion. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.

"The impact of ICT use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults. Purpose: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities.41 Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties.12,19,41 However, prior research is not consistent in whether ICTs increase or decrease isolation and loneliness among older adults.12,19,26,41 The purpose of this study is to examine how ICT use impacts the social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. Method: Data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama is used. Simple regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship between frequency of Internet use and isolation and loneliness. As the data comes from an intervention study (ICT training vs. No training), the analyses controlled for the arm of the study participants were in. Results &amp; Discussion: Results from post intervention surveys show that going online more frequently was associated with lower levels of loneliness and isolation. Greater frequency of Internet use was associated with greater quantity and ease of contact with others. Using the Internet may be beneficial for decreasing loneliness and increasing social contact among older adults in assisted and independent living communities.",1,1,1,1

Many experienced bridge engineers have retired and the number of engineers has been reduced. It is, then, urgent how to inherit their knowledge and experience. The purpose of this study is to propose E-learning system in the field of civil engineering. In this study, it is proposed system that E-learning system to apply the SNS in order to improve the effective and efficient education effect. The applicability of the proposed system is verified in the field of civil engineering. © 2012 IEEE.",0,0,0,0
"Analysis of elderly persons' social network: Need for an appropriate online platform. The increasing demographic change and the upcoming technology affinity of the elderly population provide many Internet-based opportunities for social interconnection. Thus, we focus on the status quo of social contacts, the use of the Internet as well as online information offerings and support in the neighborhood for the target group (age of 60 to 90). Hence, two partial standardized surveys including 37 and 50 participants with average ages of 68 and 71 years were conducted respectively. Results indicate that social contacts decrease with age and 75 per cent of the seniors already use the Internet. Thus, there is a general high importance of several web-based information offerings.

"Reactions to a remote-controlled video-communication robot in seniors' homes: a pilot study of feasibility and acceptance. OBJECTIVE: Remote telepresence provided by tele-operated robotics represents a new means for obtaining important health information, improving older adults' social and daily functioning and providing peace of mind to family members and caregivers who live remotely. In this study we tested the feasibility of use and acceptance of a remotely controlled robot with video-communication capability in independently living, cognitively intact older adults.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mobile remotely controlled robot with video-communication ability was placed in the homes of eight seniors. The attitudes and preferences of these volunteers and those of family or friends who communicated with them remotely via the device were assessed through survey instruments.RESULTS: Overall experiences were consistently positive, with the exception of one user who subsequently progressed to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. Responses from our participants indicated that in general they appreciated the potential of this technology to enhance their physical health and well-being, social connectedness, and ability to live independently at home. Remote users, who were friends or adult children of the participants, were more likely to test the mobility features and had several suggestions for additional useful applications.CONCLUSIONS: Results from the present study showed that a small sample of independently living, cognitively intact older adults and their remote collaterals responded positively to a remote controlled robot with video-communication capabilities. Research is needed to further explore the feasibility and acceptance of this type of technology with a variety of patients and their care contacts.",1,1,1,1

"Television reception practices in high school students from Punta Arenas [Prácticas de recepción televisiva en estudiantes de enseñanza media de Punta Arenas]. Despite new technologies that have emerged in recent times and that have been inserted in the daily routines of a large segment of the population; television continues emerging as one of the main cultural phenomena. While there are broad and diverse national and international studies that explore the relationship of certain social groups with the television media, there is no research in Punta Arenas that provides insight into the specific experiences of social groups that inhabit this geographical and socio-cultural context. This study identified the experiences of high school students from Punta Arenas with television from an area which wasn't limited only to the specific interaction with the television apparatus, but including aspects related to their daily routine in schools, family and social environment in general. Thus, using a qualitative approach, various practices of television reception thematically consistent at group level were identified through social discourses of students from various schools of Punta Arenas, despite maintaining different dynamics at an individual level. These are the structuring of a daily routine that determines the interaction with television, the conviction of the students on the influence of media, its relationship with social institutions, the preference of certain television contents, the dynamics and ways of watching TV and the existence of a critical speech towards television programming. In this way, as other investigations have agreed that television helped limit the hegemony of school as the only means to access information, this study also concluded that the school remains at the top of social interactions of the students. In this context, and noting the significance in the transformation of the schools that may or are have already been provoked by the information technologies, further work is required in order to consider the investigations around the interaction of various social groups- children, adolescents, adults, elderly, etc..., with these displays, not only in the school context, but in daily routines.",0,0,0,0
"The role of ICT and networking in healthy ageing. In this paper, we report the results from the psychological assessment conducted using a test battery composed of cognitive and social wellbeing tests and questionnaires performed by users and controls that participated in the AGNES project in Spain, Sweden and Greece at the beginning of the study and after the deployment of the first prototype. The project carries out novel technological interventions in an emerging area in ageing research. The main innovation is the integration of different technological components and social networking to provide a novel solution to the ageing population living at home. The motivation was based on relevant findings on the psychology of ageing and the need for technologies to support the ageing population. End-users have been heavily involved, providing design input, continuum evaluation and feedback. Theproject focuses on improving the mental and physical wellbeing of elderly people living at home, who often suffer the effects of social and physical isolation including cognitive decline, low activity levels and poor mood states. The main results were that the users but not the control participants improved cognitive performance andthe feeling of being treated with respect, being independent, self-realization and greater achievement.",1,1,1,0
"Analyze the digital watermarking security demands for the facebook website. When a digital service wants to protect its service quality, it needs to focus on the importance of copyright. Digital watermarking is commonly used as a protection mechanism for files posted on the Internet. In recent years, the launching of social networking websites has highlighted the importance of looking into digital content security. In this study, the characteristics of digital watermarking and the influencing factors of digital rights management were used to analyze digital content providers' needs for managing digital rights. The results showed that value, share, protection, and management are four factors that can be used to analyze a digital content provider's requirements. Furthermore, it was found that digital content providers give importance to the management of the content that they share; and when they share contents online, they want to prevent illegal attacks. Different providers were then analyzed, and it was found that the female respondents often share digital content, so they need digital protection more than the male respondents. Older people were found to be very careful about the value of the digital content that they post online; they need protection to preserve that value. If the digital content industry and the Internet can provide appropriate digital rights management for users, those users will be satisfied in using it. © 2012 IEEE.",0,0,0,0
"Bewell+: Multi-dimensional wellbeing monitoring with community-guided user feedback and energy optimization. Smartphone sensing and persuasive feedback design is enabling a new generation of wellbeing applications capable of automatically monitoring multiple aspects of physical and mental health. In this paper, we present BeWell+ the next generation of the BeWell smartphone health app, which continuously monitors user behavior along three distinct health dimensions, namely sleep, physical activity, and social interaction. BeWell promotes improved behavioral patterns via feedback rendered as an ambient display on the smartphone's wallpaper. With BeWell+, we introduce new wellbeing mechanisms to address challenges identified during the initial deployment of the BeWell app; specifically, (i) community adaptive wellbeing feedback, which automatically generalize to diverse user communities (e.g., elderly, young adults, children) by balancing the need to promote better behavior yet remains realistic to the user's goals; and, (ii) wellbeing adaptive energy allocation, which prioritizes monitoring fidelity and feedback responsiveness on specific health dimensions of wellbeing (e.g., social interaction) where the user needs most help. We evaluate the performance of these mechanisms as part of an initial deployment and user study that includes 27 people using BeWell+ over a 19 day field trial. Our findings show that not only can BeWell+ operate successfully on consumergrade smartphones, but users understand feedback and respond by taking positive steps towards leading healthier lifestyles.",0,1,0,0
"V2me: Evaluating the first steps in mobile friendship coaching. Life events, such as retirement or being widowed, can change the social circle of older people considerably. It may be difficult to find new social contacts when one has never got used to, or perhaps even never learnt, to seek and maintain those contacts. Loneliness has many negative effects for well-being, including depression and even cardiovascular disease. The Ambient Assisted Living Joint Programme (AAL-JP) research project V2me seeks to find a solution for alleviating loneliness by means of easy-to-use technology including touch screen devices. The idea is to use a virtual coach for encouraging users to take an active role in contacting people and teaching them how to initiate and maintain meaningful and enduring relations. The first step, in the process of creating the complete virtual coach-assisted system for preventing loneliness, is to create a proto type and use the feedback from older users for developing the system. In this paper we discuss the results of the first pilot and what steps need to be taken next. © 2012-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",1,0,0,0

"Automated behavioral mapping for monitoring social interactions among older adults. Social interactions in retirement communities' shared spaces is a key component to preventing social isolation and loneliness among older people. Given the underutilization of these spaces, placing technologies to promote socialization in shared spaces might improve independence and quality of life among older adults. In order to understand socializations in these shared spaces, surveillance systems must be developed to quantify the number and type of interactions in an environment. We hypothesize that social interactions amongst older adults can be detected using multiple cameras and microphones strategically placed in the environment. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of an automatic behavioral mapping surveillance system designed for monitoring interactions among older adults and technology interventions in retirement communities' shared common areas. Specific emphasis is given to the system designed to monitor the number, length and type of interactions of older adults in the community. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",0,0,0,0
"Independence and mobility in later life. This paper explores independence in later life and its relations with mobility, or embodied movements through physical space on the basis of a review of a range of academic literature and in-depth interviews with community-dwelling adults aged 70 and more in the UK. We suggest that independence is a complex and fuzzy notion that is best thought of as a qualitative multiplicity and as an unstable achievement fabricated out of dependencies on bodies, technologies, infrastructures, social networks and other elements. Yet we also find that the study participants understand independent mobility as avoiding lifts provided by next of kin, friends or others for getting around. This is tied to the enactment of particular forms of embodiment and ageist subject positions for older people and implies that older adults are inadvertently complicit in the perpetuation of the connotations of dependency in later life with passivity, burden and undesirability. To counteract these tendencies, we end this paper by elaborating more inclusive and broader conceptualisations of dependence, independence and independent mobility in later life. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",1,0,0,0
"Key factors influencing the development of Orange Technology Game: An exploratory study on orchid planting game. Orange Technology, a concept that originated in Taiwan, sets the goal to bring more happiness and promote mental wellness for the elderly. This study adopted a virtual orchid planting game symbolizing Orange Technology for a case study through explorative panel discussion followed by focus group interviews which separately included elderly and middle-aged people. This study aimed to find key factors influencing the development of Orange Technology Game (OTG) by introducing technology acceptance model (TAM) analysis. The results show that providing more recreational experiences (RE) and enhancing game induced self-efficacy (GISE) are two key factors, in which, memory improvement, social contact and self-learning are identified for RE, and perceived enjoyment, emotional stability and knowledge exchange are identified for GISE. Moreover, a hypothesis for seniors' TAM is proposed as that GISE will mediate RE to influence seniors' happiness & mental wellness along three identified dimensions of ""mental health care"", ""social relationships"" and ""leisure atisfaction"". In addition, middle-aged people showed more enthusiasm than elderly people for each dimension, such that Orange Technology game should shed light on these key factors to fulfill the needs of elder care. © 2012 IEEE.",1,0,0,0
"A theory-based online hip fracture resource center for caregivers: Effects on dyads. Background: Hip fracture is a serious injury for older adults, usually requiring surgical repair and extensive therapy. Informal caregivers can help older adults make a successful recovery by encouraging them to adhere to the therapy plans and improve their health behaviors. Few resources, however, are available for these caregivers to learn about how to assist their care receivers and cope with their unique caregiving situations. Objective: The study aims were to develop a comprehensive theory-based online hip fracture resource center (OHRC) for caregivers, Caring for Caregivers, and conducted a feasibility trial. Methods: The OHRC included self-learning modules, discussion boards, Ask the Experts, and a virtual library. The feasibility of the intervention was assessed by usage and usability. The feasibility of the future trial was tested using a one-group pre-post design on 36 caregiver-care receiver dyads recruited from six hospitals. The caregivers used the OHRC for 8 weeks. The impact of the intervention was assessed on both caregivers (primary) and care receivers (secondary). The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, paired t tests, and content analyses. Results: On average, caregivers reviewed five modules and used the discussion board 3.1 times. The mean perceived usability score for the OHRC was 74.04 ± 7.26 (range, 12-84). Exposure to the OHRC significantly improved caregivers' knowledge about the care of hip fracture patients (t = 3.17, p = .004) and eHealth literacy (t = 2.43, p = .002). Changes in other caregiver outcomes (e.g., strain, coping, and social support) and care receiver outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy for exercise and osteoporosis medication adherence) were favorable but not significant. Discussion: The findings suggest that the OHRC was user-friendly and could be beneficial for caregivers. Additional larger-scale trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of the intervention on outcomes. © 2012 Lippincott Williams amp; Wilkins.",1,1,1,1
"Caregiving burden and out-of-home mobility of cognitively impaired care-recipients based on GPS tracking. Background: Out-of-home mobility refers to the realization of trips outside the home, by foot or by other means of transportation. Although out-of-home mobility is important for the well-being of older people with cognitive impairment, its importance for their caregivers is not clear. This study aims to clarify the relationship between caregiving burden and out-of-home mobility of care-recipients using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) technology. Methods: Seventy-six dyads (care-recipients and caregivers) were recruited from a psychogeriatric center, where they underwent cognitive assessment, followed by psychosocial interviews at home. Care-recipients received GPS tracking kits to carry for a period of four weeks, whenever they left home. Mobility data and diagnostic and psychosocial data were examined in relation to caregiver burden. Results: The strongest predictors of burden were care-recipients lower cognitive status and more time spent walking out-of-home. An interaction was found between cognitive status and time spent walking in relation to caregiver burden. The relationship between walking and burden was stronger among caregivers of carerecipients with dementia than caregivers of care-recipients with no cognitive impairment or mild cognitive impairment. Care-recipients behavioral and emotional states were also positively related to caregiver burden. Conclusions: The findings stress the importance of maintaining older persons out-of-home mobility during cognitive decline. © International Psychogeriatric Association 2012.",0,0,0,1
"The relationship between atrophy of the medial temporal area and daily activities in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Background and aims: Many studies have suggested that social network, leisure activity, and physical activity can have protective effects against dementia and Alzheimer's disease. However, previous studies have not examined the relationship between daily activities and brain atrophy in older adults. This study aimed to explore what kind of daily activities were associated with atrophy of the medial temporal area including the entorhinal cortex (MTA-ERC) in older adults. Methods: In total, 122 older adults (aged 65 and over) with subjective memory complaints or a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5 underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and MTA-ERC atrophy was assessed by the voxel- based morphometry method. Based on magnetic resonance imaging data, the subjects were divided into atrophy and non-atrophy groups. Daily activities were assessed using a 20-item questionnaire (e.g., instrumental activities of daily living, social activities), and we compared activity participation between the groups. Results: The atrophy group (n=37) showed significantly lower participation in 4 out of 20 activity items (cleaning, intellectual activity, culture lessons, and using a personal computer) than the non-atrophy group (n=85). Summed scores of these 4 items (range from 0 to 4) were significantly associated with MTA-ERC atrophy even after adjustment for age, sex, education status, and Mini-Mental State Examination score. Conclusions: In conclusion, MTAERC atrophy was associated with cognitive activities or household-related activities requiring planning. © 2012, Editrice Kurtis.",1,0,0,1
"Inadequate Health Literacy among Elderly Immigrants: Characteristics, Contributing, and Service Utilization Factors. Inadequate health literacy among elderly immigrants in the United States is an important social issue that needs immediate attention to decrease health disparities. This study examines the causes and consequences of inadequate health literacy among the elderly immigrants. Characteristics of the elderly immigrants are presented including their diverse backgrounds, physical health, mental health, and substance use. Barriers and contributing factors such as elderly immigrants' education and English proficiency, income and poverty levels, Medicare or insurance, immigration issues, and social support are also examined. The literature regarding heath literacy service options (print and online sources, health literacy training for caregivers, and church health literacy training) are reviewed. Findings from the reviewed literature indicate that immigrants' social network, particularly family members, play significant roles in their health care decision making and, thus, health literacy intervention and services should include elderly immigrants' social network. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1,0,0,0
"Can mobile health deliver participatory medicine to all citizens in modern society?. In Finland, Cardio Vascular Diseases (CVD) made up 41% of all causes of death in 2005. Best of art health IT technologies are not accessible to everyone. Replacing lifestyle and behavior with easy to adopt social routines can also prevent other non-communicable diseases like weight disorders, diabetes, depression, dementia and musculoskeletal illness. In this paper we present the health-e-living concept: a mobile solution to deliver preventive, educational and promotional health to all citizens comfortable with IT technologies independently of their age or geographical location. The system includes a mobile phone application to collect personal data from sensors related to exercise activity, food intake and moods with minimal user intervention. The data collected is processed by an automatic learning classifier and presented to a nurse capable of instructing for better health behavior and to keep user progress on the targeted track. Health-e-Living uses the metaphor of social networks to improve health habits of persons connected to their support network in real life (family, friends, and colleagues). The first RCT covered 35-45 year old men with cardiovascular risk factors consenting on being monitored for over 12 weeks. The vitals collected are heart rate, glucose, BMI, blood pressure and emotional state along with daily pictures of their meals. The barriers and facilitators for lifestyle change are assessed during the trial period. The study showed that a generic platform is useful in medical research and protocol pilots.

"Characteristics and usage patterns of older people in a 3D online multi-user virtual environment. 3D online multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs) have a lot of potential in supporting older people in their daily lives, yet little research has been conducted to explore how older people engage with this type of technology. This paper aims to investigate the characteristics, user groups and activity patterns (particularly social networks and gift giving behaviour) of older users within a 3D online multi-user virtual environment. Data from approximately 5000 online user profiles of older and younger users from a 3D MUVE, namely IMVU, was collected for analysis. Overall, we identified several distinct patterns of use (e.g. size of social ties, level of reciprocity, etc.) among older users when compared with younger users. We also found that despite the capabilities of 3D MUVEs to provide the users immersion in alternative realities, a feature well embraced by younger users in this study, older users seemed more interested in activities which serve as an extension to their physical life. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Rule-Based Modeling of Chronic Disease Epidemiology: Elderly Depression as an Illustration. Background: Rule-based Modeling (RBM) is a computer simulation modeling methodology already used to model infectious diseases. Extending this technique to the assessment of chronic diseases, mixing quantitative and qualitative data appear to be a promising alternative to classical methods. Elderly depression reveals an important source of comorbidities. Yet, the intertwined relationship between late-life events and the social support of the elderly person remains difficult to capture. We illustrate the usefulness of RBM in modeling chronic diseases using the example of elderly depression in Belgium. Methods: We defined a conceptual framework of interactions between late-life events and social support impacting elderly depression. This conceptual framework was underpinned by experts' opinions elicited through a questionnaire. Several scenarios were implemented successively to better mimic the real population, and to explore a treatment effect and a socio-economic distinction. The simulated patterns of depression by age were compared with empirical patterns retrieved from the Belgian Health Interview Survey. Results: Simulations were run using different groupings of experts' opinions on the parameters. The results indicate that the conceptual framework can reflect a realistic evolution of the prevalence of depression. Indeed, simulations combining the opinions of well-selected experts and a treatment effect showed no significant difference with the empirical pattern. Conclusions: Our conceptual framework together with a quantification of parameters through elicited expert opinions improves the insights into possible dynamics driving elderly depression. While RBM does not require high-level skill in mathematics or computer programming, the whole implementation process provides a powerful tool to learn about complex chronic diseases, combining advantages of both quantitative and qualitative approaches. © 2012 Chiêm et al.",0,0,0,1
"Persuading older adults to socialize and exercise through ambient games. Families are increasingly using Social Networking Sites (SNS) to keep in touch.

"Benefits and hurdles for older adults in intergenerational online interactions. In order to foster the relationship between geographically distant grandparents and grandchildren, a prototype of an online platform is developed in an Ambient Assisted Living project. After identifying relevant attributes in the requirements analysis together with older adults and experts for children, we conducted two rounds of user studies in a laboratory setting with older adults. In the studies we were not only interested in the usability of the platform and the older participants' computer skills, but especially in the experiences the older users have when interacting with and via the platform. As expected, we found a relation between self-rated computer skills and the usability problems. However, the skills were not decisive for experiencing the interaction regarding curiosity, engagement, social connectedness and social presence. Finally, implications for the design of socially connecting online platforms are presented. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",1,0,0,0
"Help needed inmedication self-management for people with visual impairment: Case-control study. Background: Visual impairment (VI) is rising in prevalence and contributing to increasing morbidity, particularly among older people. Understanding patients' problems is fundamental to achieving optimal health outcomes but little is known about how VI impacts on self-management of medication. Aim: To compare issues relating to medication self-management between older people with and without VI. Design and setting: Case-control study with participants aged ≥65 years, prescribed at least two long-termoral medications daily, living within the community. Method: The study recruited 156 patients with VI (best corrected visual acuity [BCVA] 6/18 to 3/60) at low-vision clinics; community optometrists identified 158 controls (BCVA 6/9 or better). Researchers visited participants in their homes, administered two validated questionnaires to assessmedication adherence (Morisky; Medication Adherence Report Scale [MARS]), and asked questions about medication self-management, beliefs, and support. Results: Approximately half of the participants in both groups reported perfect adherence on both questionnaires (52.5% Morisky; 43.3%, MARS). Despite using optical aids, few (3%) with VI could readmedication information clearly; 24%had difficulty distinguishing different tablets. More people with VI (29%) than controls (13%) (odds ratio [OR] = 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6 to 5.0) needed help managing their medication, from friends (19% versus 10%) or pharmacists (10% versus 2.5%; OR = 4.4, 95%CI = 1.4 to 13.5); more received social service support (OR = 7.1; 95% CI = 3.9 to 12.9). Conclusion: Compared to their peers without VI, older people with VI aremore than twice as likely to need help in managing medication. In clinical practice in primary care, patients' needs for practical support in taking prescribed treatment must be recognised. Strategies for effective medication self-management should be explored. ©British Journal of General Practice.",1,1,1,1
"Age differences in the perception of social presence in the use of 3D virtual world for social interaction. 3D virtual worlds are becoming increasingly popular as tool for social interaction, with the potential of augmenting the user's perception of physical and social presence. Thus, this technology could be of great benefit to older people, providing home-bound older users with access to social, educational and recreational resources. However, so far there have been few studies looking into how older people engage with virtual worlds, as most research in this area focuses on younger users. In this study, an online experiment was conducted with 30 older and 30 younger users to investigate age differences in the perception of presence in the use of virtual worlds for social interaction. Overall, we found that factors such as navigation and prior experience with text messaging tools played a key role in older people's perception of presence. Both physical and social presence was found to be linked to the quality of social interaction for users of both age groups. In addition, older people displayed proxemic behavior which was more similar to proxemic behavior in the physical world when compared to younger users. © 2012 British Informatics Society Limited.

"Impact of computer training courses on reduction of loneliness of older people in Finland and Slovenia. Previous research has shown loneliness as a threat for the quality of life of older people; therefore the goal of the intervention in a quasi-experimental study was to evaluate and discuss the self-reported level of loneliness of older people in Finland and Slovenia before and after a computer intervention. Intervention in a quasi-experimental study was conducted among 58 older participants at the baseline (M = 72.4 years) and 45 older participants at the follow-up research study (M = 72.9 years). Inferential statistics showed a significant difference in the reduction of loneliness between the countries, and a decreased level of loneliness of older people after completing the computer training course. Although older people experience many age-related problems which may reduce their interest in learning information and communication technology (ICT) skills, it is important that they are computer-proficient, because computer engagement can reduce the level of loneliness of older people and in this way has a positive effect on their quality of life. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Depression: A modifiable factor in fearful older fallers transitioning to frailty?. Objective Fear of falling is one of the most common fears among community-dwelling older people and is as serious a health problem as falls themselves. Understanding fear of falling in fallers transitioning to frailty may help us identify effective strategies to reduce it in this already vulnerable group of older people. Our aim was to evaluate the psychological factors associated with fear of falling in a group of fallers transitioning to frailty when compared with robust or non-frail fallers. Methods Cross-sectional design where 301 fallers underwent assessment at the Technology Research for Independent Living Clinic in Dublin () is seen. Fear of falling was measured using the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale, and frailty was measured using the Biological Syndrome Model. Psychological measures included assessment of anxiety, depression, loneliness, personality factors and cognition. Results Frailer fallers had increased fear of falling when compared with robust fallers (p < 0.001). Age, female gender and lower cognitive scores were associated with greater fear of falling in the robust group. For frailer fallers, higher depression score was the only factor associated with fear of falling on multivariate analysis. The odds ratio of having case level depressive disorder (CESD-8 ≥ 4) if you were a frailer faller was significantly higher than if you were robust (OR = 2.6, CI 1.3-5.2, p = 0.006). Conclusion Fallers at a transitional level of frailty may represent a particularly vulnerable group psychologically who would benefit most from interventional stratagies with specific intervention components addressing depressive symptoms.

Participants were evaluated pre-therapy, post-therapy, and at 6 weeks follow-up using standardized clinical measures. Computerized measures of supported arm reach and game performance were stored on a remote server. Results: Five participants had clinically significant improvements in their active range of shoulder movement, shoulder strength, grasp strength, and their ability to focus. Several participants demonstrated substantially higher arm function (measured with the Fugl-Meyer test) and two were less-depressed (measured with the Becks Depression Inventory, Second Edition). The BrightArm technology was well-accepted by the participants, who gave it an overall subjective rating of 4.1 on a 5 point Likert scale. Conclusions: Given these preliminary findings, it will be beneficial to evaluate the BrightArm through controlled clinical trials and to investigate its application to other clinical populations. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.",1,1,1,1
"Working conditions as risk factors for disability retirement: A longitudinal register linkage study. Background: Early retirement due to disability is a public health and work environment problem that shortens working careers. Transition to disability retirement is based on ill-health, but working conditions are also of relevance. We examined the contributions of work arrangements, physical working conditions and psychosocial working conditions to subsequent disability retirement. Methods: The data were derived from the Helsinki Health Study cohort on employees of the City of Helsinki, Finland. Information on working conditions was obtained from the baseline surveys conducted in 2000, 2001 and 2002. These data were linked with register data on disability retirement and their main diagnoses obtained from the Finnish Centre for Pensions. Follow up by the end of 2008 yielded 525 disability retirement events. The analysed data included 6525 participants and 525 disability retirement events. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated from Cox regression analysis. Results: Several working conditions showed own associations with disability retirement before adjustment. After adjustment for all working conditions, the primary risk factors for all-cause disability retirement were physical workload among women (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.57-2.59) and men (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.18-3.38), and low job control among women (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.29-1.99). In addition, for disability retirement due to musculoskeletal causes, the risk factors were physical workload and low job control. For disability retirement due to mental causes the risk factors were computer work and low job control. Furthermore, occupational class was a risk factor for disability retirement due to all causes and musculoskeletal diseases. Conclusions: Among various working conditions, those that are physically demanding and those that imply low job control are potential risk factors for disability retirement. Improving the physical working environment and enhancing control over ones job is likely to help prevent early retirement due to disability. © 2012 Lahelma et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",1,0,0,1
"A usability protocol for evaluating online social networks. Online Social Networking (OSN) has become one of the biggest successes of the Internet. Facebook is the most popular service with over 800 million users. OSN have the potential to combat feelings of social isolation amongst the aging population. This study has investigated how people with differing levels of experience using OSN, within different age categories, are able to interact with the core features of Facebook. The goal has been to identify concessions and produce guidelines for designing an OSN for older people. This paper presents quantitative findings from a usability study which utilized eye tracking to observe 20 users' interactions with Facebook. The usability issues that were encountered and how these may be addressed to help older people with social isolation are discussed. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",0,0,0,0
"Triumph of hope over experience: Learning from interventions to reduce avoidable hospital admissions identified through an academic health and social care network. Background: Internationally health services are facing increasing demands due to new and more expensive health technologies and treatments, coupled with the needs of an ageing population. Reducing avoidable use of expensive secondary care services, especially high cost admissions where no procedure is carried out, has become a focus for the commissioners of healthcare. Method. We set out to identify, evaluate and share learning about interventions to reduce avoidable hospital admission across a regional Academic Health and Social Care Network (AHSN). We conducted a service evaluation identifying initiatives that had taken place across the AHSN. This comprised a literature review, case studies, and two workshops. Results: We identified three types of intervention: pre-hospital; within the emergency department (ED); and post-admission evaluation of appropriateness. Pre-hospital interventions included the use of predictive modelling tools (PARR - Patients at risk of readmission and ACG - Adjusted Clinical Groups) sometimes supported by community matrons or virtual wards. GP-advisers and outreach nurses were employed within the ED. The principal post-hoc interventions were the audit of records in primary care or the application of the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP) within the admission ward. Overall there was a shortage of independent evaluation and limited evidence that each intervention had an impact on rates of admission. Conclusions: Despite the frequency and cost of emergency admission there has been little independent evaluation of interventions to reduce avoidable admission. Commissioners of healthcare should consider interventions at all stages of the admission pathway, including regular audit, to ensure admission thresholds dont change. © 2012 Woodhams et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",0,0,0,1
"Linking the lonely: An exploration of a communication technology designed to support social interaction among older adults. This article explores mixed methods data gathered from a pilot of a communication system prototype in the homes of 19 older adults over a period of 10 weeks. The system has been designed to enhance communication among both friends and strangers and has been developed as a possible tool to increase interaction in older adults suffering from social isolation and loneliness. The paper uses remote logging data to inform discussion of how such a technology was received and utilised over time in a home setting. Qualitative data gathered via entry and exit interviews, and weekly checkpoint calls were used to provide deeper insight into patterns and practices identified via the logs. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",1,1,1,0
"Without it I am nothing': The internet in the lives of older immigrants. This article aims to explore how using the internet may facilitate coping with the challenges of immigration in later life, based on the case of older Jewish immigrants from the Former Soviet Union in Israel. For that purpose, in-depth interviews were conducted with 32 immigrants living in southern Israel. Results indicated that internet usages by the study participants were: (1) Managing health; (2) Nurturing professional interests; (3) Maintaining and extending social networks; (4) Appreciating the past; and (5) Enjoying leisure. Each usage seemed to preserve and even strengthen the participants' self-worth and improve their quality of life. These findings suggest that older immigrants who use the internet practice, in fact, strategies of successful ageing, which help them to cope not only with the challenges associated with ageing, but also with the tremendous difficulties and losses posed by immigration. © The Author(s) 2011.",1,0,0,0
"Engaging patients in managing their health care: patient perceptions of the effect of a total joint replacement presurgical class.. To engage patients in managing their health care especially in relation to a total joint replacement (TJR). With the aging of the American population and the advent of new technology, there is an increase in TJRs. As the pendulum swings from evidence-based medicine to patient-centered medicine, presurgical education is preparing patients for their surgical experience. Most research studies on such education are quantitative in nature, preventing patients' voices from being heard. Using a success case narrative design, 24 patients mainly from the Kaiser Permanente Downey Medical Center were interviewed regarding their pre- and postsurgical experiences. The study findings demonstrate that patient education, in the form of classes, with recognition of the participants' physical needs, social needs, concrete supports, and psychological needs as well as the willingness of the participants to work with their health care team can promote patient engagement and improved quality of life. The TJR class was found to promote a sense of social connectedness and fostered participants' independence. The results of this study can assist health care professionals to improve their practice by designing presurgical programs to meet the needs of their patients.",1,0,0,0
"State of the (net)work address Developing criteria for applying social networking to the work environment. In an increasingly faster paced innovative world, maintaining the ability to innovate in spite of an aging work force will become every company's strongest leverage for success. Tapping the latent knowledge resources and creativity of overlooked employees and persisting crucial information for business conduct are promising results for social networking sites (SNS) in a working context. Usability and usefulness are exponential factors in creating a successful SNS. In order to make a SNS usable for a heterogeneous user group, analyses of user diversity in regard to social media need to be done. Furthermore differences in communication medium and frequency in regard to age, content, hierarchy position, departmental thresholds and company size need to be analyzed. For analysis purposes both qualitative and quantitative research methods were applied. Strong effects of age and communication content were found in survey with 194 participants. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",0,0,0,0
"A study on construction of a community tool with a social network service for uniting older and younger people. To find out how much social network service (SNS) information older people had, a preparatory investigation was conducted using a questionnaire. The subjects were 1 man and 51 women going to a dance studio in Yokohama City. The results showed that although they had some interest in SNS, they did not have much knowledge of the service. Therefore we conducted another investigation into needs for general SNS functions using a questionnaire. The subjects were dance trainees and staff of a junior high school and a high school, totaling approximately 100 persons. Furthermore we asked 229 students of a junior high school and a high school the same questions. The analysis of the results revealed that younger people's needs are clearly different from older people's. We found out that to meet the older people's needs it is necessary to communicate using ones' real names like world-famous Facebook, not Japanese mixi type services, and expand the functions according to each person's needs. In this paper are mentioned what kind of community older people (a typical digital divide example) want, whether or not SNS can be a community tool for uniting older and younger people, and also show how an SNS site should be constructed. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",1,0,0,0
"Mobile phones and elderly people: A noisy communication. Knowing the users is capital for building user-friendly digital interfaces. One way to think about the users is considering their familiarity with this technology. This article presents the results of twelve interviews with elderly people residing in the so-called South Zone of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) who have used mobile phones over at least one year. It is part of the Doctor's Thesis ""Mobile phones for elderly people - usability for social integration"" (""Celulares para idosos - usabilidade a serviço da integraço social""), which is targeted at ascertaining if the current mobile phones are user-friendly for elderly people. Through the technique of Guided Interviews, we found usage time, criteria for choice of phones, reasons for changes, preferences, and manners of use. Preliminarily, we have noticed differences in the behavior of the participating users and performed a qualitative analysis according to groups of age and gender. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

"Reconstructing the past: Personal memory technologies are not just personal and not just for memory. Research has shown that personal memory technologies are a promising way to address the needs of older adults with memory impairments. In this article, we review three recently completed studies that evaluated technologies for personal memories intended for persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In the first study, we worked with 12 participants with AD or MCI and their families to construct DVD-based Multimedia Biographies that depicted prominent events, people, and places from the participant's past. We then evaluated over a period of 6 months psychosocial effects that viewing the biographies had on the participants and their family members. These effects included stimulating reminiscence of past events, triggering predominantly positive emotions of happiness and occasional moments of sadness, and engaging conversations with family members. In our second study, we designed a home-based ambient display that allowed a man with AD to similarly review his past life, in combination with recent photos automatically captured by a lifelogging device called SenseCam. Psychometric tests and semistructured interviews revealed how the intervention appeared to improve the participant's sense of self and lower apathy. In our final study of 5 cognitively impaired participants we compared representations of recent experiences captured with SenseCam in 3 ways: with the raw image stream, with a slide show consisting of a selected number of SenseCam images narrated by a family member, and with a control reviewing no images. Results included evidence that reviewing SenseCam images improved episodic recall for personal events depicted in the images for 4 of the 5 participants. Based on lessons learned from this research, we suggest that personal memory technologies should not just be framed as systems for augmenting an individual user's capacity for accurate recall of personal events, but instead should support groups of people such as members of a family in telling their life stories. This conception yields benefits beyond the support of memory, such as fostering a sense of self and strengthening interpersonal relationships with family members. We conclude the article by presenting design considerations to help guide and inform the development and evaluation of future personal memory technologies. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1,1,1,0
"Factors associated with perceived health in older adult Irish population. Objectives: Perceived health status or self-reported health declines with age and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, poor mental health and functional outcomes and health care utilisation. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between a range of biopsychosocial measures and self-reported health in a sample of community-dwelling older people living in Dublin. Method: A total of 492 participants with a mean age of 72.5 (SD=7.34) were assessed at the Technology Research for Independent Living (TRIL) clinic, a comprehensive geriatric assessment facility in St James's Hospital, Dublin, using standardised measures of medical morbidity, personality, functional status, depression, anxiety, perceived stress, cognition, loneliness and social support. The relationship between self-rated health and health measures was analysed using bivariate correlations and backward multiple regression. Indirect pathways of effects on perceived health were evaluated using bootstrapping mediation analysis. Results: Self-rated health was best predicted by instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), Charlson Co-morbidity Index (CCI), extraversion and perceived stress. The effects of cognition and social support from friends on self-rated health were found to be mediated by elements of these identified factors. Conclusion: Self-rated health is not simply the absence of physical illness but is also strongly influenced by the degree of functional impairment, personality factors and the level of stress experienced by the older person. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",1,0,0,1
"Health Care Service Needs and Correlates of Quality of Life: A Case Study of Elderly Chinese Immigrants in Canada. This study explored the health care service needs and the major correlates of quality of life among 127 community-dwelling elderly Chinese immigrants in a western Canadian city. Participants were interviewed in their homes by trained, bilingual interviewers employing a structured questionnaire that covered a wide range of topics including health care service needs, living arrangements, health status, social network, life satisfaction, and socio-demographic information. Results demonstrated that ethnic nursing homes, senior centres that provide programs and services, and homemaker services were respondents' major service needs. Multiple ordinary least-squares regression analysis revealed that respondents who emigrated from Mainland China and those who exhibited greater psychological well-being, reported being physically more mobile, perceived fewer service needs, and expressed satisfaction with the quality of their neighbourhood demonstrated higher levels of life satisfaction. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",1,0,0,0
"Coping with the cold - Exploring relationships between cold housing, health and social wellbeing in a sample of older people in Ireland. Purpose - Older people are vulnerable to fuel poverty on the island of Ireland. This paper seeks to explore the lived experiences of older people in cold weather with a view to informing fuel poverty policy and service responses. Design/methodology/approach - A postal and online survey utilising an opportunistic sample of older people living in Ireland and linked with a range of services/community and voluntary groups was undertaken in January-April 2011. Data on the experiences of 722 older people in the cold weather of winter 2010/2011 were analysed in the context of socio-economic, health, and housing circumstances. Findings - During the period of extreme cold weather half of the sample reported that they went without other household necessities due to the cost of home-heating. In general, 62 per cent of those surveyed worried about the cost of home-heating. Homes considered ""too cold"" were more likely to lack central heating and experience damp/draughts. Staying indoors, keeping the heating on, and eating hot food/drinks were common responses to cold weather but a diverse range of behaviours was observed. Associations were observed between living in a cold home and higher levels of chronic illness, falls and loneliness, and fewer social activities. Research limitations/implications - The sample cannot be considered nationally representative; single occupancy and social housing units were overrepresented. Originality/value - This research found significant associations between living in a cold home/difficulty paying for heating, and aspects of ill-health and social exclusion. While no causal association can be assumed, this phenomenon has implications for policies supporting healthy ageing. Copyright © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.",1,0,0,1
"Impact of environmental factors in home rehabilitation - A qualitative study from the perspective of older persons using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health to describe facilitators and barriers. Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore older people's experience of environmental factors that impact on their activity and participation in home rehabilitation. Method: Older people aged between 68 and 93 years and receiving home rehabilitation were interviewed. A qualitative content analysis was performed on the interview text using the predetermined structure of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) environmental domain. The text was linked to the closest ICF category. Results: The results identified environmental facilitators and barriers that influenced activity and participation among older people receiving home rehabilitation. Approaches that provided a facilitative environment were access to assistive products and technologies, alterations to the physical environment, social support and relationships, and adjusted health and social care services. Conclusions: A qualitative study using ICF-listed environmental factors contributed a holistic view of facilitators and barriers in home rehabilitation for older people. Awareness of the importance of the impact of the social environment on activities and participation could improve home rehabilitation services for older people. The study represents an important step towards a holistic approach using the ICF, which aims to enable all health care professionals to describe, plan and evaluate rehabilitation services together with older people across the health and social care sectors.

"From high connectivity to social isolation: Communication practices of older adults in the digital age. Few studies have shown how older adults cope with communication in an age of social media where many people are in constant contact with one another. To address this, we have studied the current living and communication practices of twelve older adults using in-depth interviews and home tours. Our findings illustrate a range of routines including a preference to stay away from new technologies; high degrees of connectivity and social media acceptance; withdrawal from heavy communication to explore newfound 'me' time; and, a lack of reciprocation in communication that caused a degree of isolation. © 2012 Authors.",1,0,0,0
"Impression management work: How seniors with chronic pain address disruptions in their interactions. Chronic pain is an illness that affects nearly a third of senior citizens. Uncontrolled chronic pain can manifest constantly and/or intermittently, and can disrupt seniors' ability to plan or to maintain synchronous and scheduled contact with others. Such disruptions can expose seniors to stigma from others who do not understand this illness, social isolation, and a range of challenges to their social autonomy. We present results from an interview study of 27 seniors with chronic pain exploring how they mitigate and manage these disruptions in their lives. Drawing on Goffman's theory of impression management, we found that participants invested significant effort into controlling both the context of interactions and others' expectations, in order to mitigate the potential negative social consequences of disruptions. In performing this work, seniors were selective about what information they revealed to others about their chronic pain and availability. Given such efforts, seniors with chronic pain have unique needs for technologies to support their social interactions. © 2012 ACM.",1,0,0,0
"Psychological distress as a key component of psychosocial functioning in community-dwelling older people. Objectives: To explore the key components representative of measures of psychosocial functioning with a focus on identifying the constituents of psychological distress in an Irish sample of community-dwelling older adults and to examine the relationship between these components and health outcomes such as frailty. Method: Cross-sectional observational study at the Technology Research for Independent Living (TRIL) Clinic, a comprehensive geriatric assessment facility in St. James's Hospital, Dublin. In this study, 579 participants were given eight primary assessments (Centre for Epidemiological Studies of Depression, Geriatric Adverse Life Events Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, De Jong-Gierveld Scale, Practitioner Assessment of Network Type, Eysenck Personality Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Lubben Social Network Scale) and a broad range of health and demographic secondary assessments. Principal factor analysis identified the core components relating to psychosocial functioning. Following this, the regression factors of these components were correlated with health outcomes. Results: The first of three components identified accounted for 9.08% of the variance and related to a core internal component of psychological distress. The two other components related to external and physiological functioning, specifically social support networks and sleep. Spearman's Rho correlations indicated significant associations of walking speed, age, Berg Balance Scale and living alone with all three components. Additionally, the core component of psychological distress significantly correlated with the Fried Frailty Index, illness co-morbidity, ADL, IADL and nutrition. Conclusion: These results characterise the variation in psychosocial functioning in older adults and identifies psychological distress as a core facet of psychosocial functioning which has associations with frailty. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1,0,0,1
"Health-related factors associated with hospitalization for old people: Comparisons of elderly aged 85 in a population cohort study. The aim of this population-based study was to (1) describe living conditions and actual health care utilization among 85 year olds; (2) determine factors that affect hospital admissions in this age. The study was conducted on 85-year-old residents in Linköping municipality, Sweden. The data collected included medical records, health care utilization during the preceding 12 months and a postal questionnaire on assistance, assistive technology, functional impairment, feelings of loneliness, worries and health-related quality of life measured by the EQ-5D. Out of 650 eligible individuals, 496 (78% of those alive) participated. Despite the prevalence of multi-morbidity (68%) and mental discomfort, the majority managed self-care (85%), usual activities (74%) and had high (>60/100) self-rated health evaluated by a visual analog scale (VAS). The non-hospitalized group reported a better health status than the hospitalized group in terms of medical aspects, living conditions and subjective estimation. Factors associated with in-patient care were an increased number of general practitioner visits, more assistive technology, community assistance, multimorbidity and/or diagnosed congestive heart failure and arrhythmia. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",1,0,0,0
"""Mommy wants to learn the computer"": How middle-aged and elderly women in taiwan learn ICT through social support. The group of middle-aged and elderly women represents the lowest usage rate of information and communication technology (ICT) in Taiwan. This article reports how a social intervention program, the Taiwan Women Up (TWU) program, has helped such group to successfully learn ICT skills with the support of members of nonprofit organizations. The study adopted qualitative research methods and accomplished in-depth interviews with 28 TWU participants to reveal the ICT learning experiences of women learners. The findings show that TWU program enabled middle-aged and elderly women to achieve the goals of supporting their organizations and empowering themselves as more capable ICT users. Learning and sharing ICT experiences with fellow members helped them overcome their frustration; whereas empathetic understanding and support among members provided the main source of encouragement in the learning process. This study showed that NPOs played a critical role in identifying potential learners and sustaining the ICT project successfully. © 2012 American Association for Adult and Continuing Education.",0,0,0,0
"Mobilizing Older Adults: Harnessing the Potential of Smart Home Technologies. Contribution of the IMIA Working Group on Smart Homes and Ambient Assisted Living. OBJECTIVES: This paper highlights the potential of smart home applications to not only assess mobility determinants for older adults in the home environment but also provide the opportunity for tailored interventions.METHODS: We present a theoretical framework for assessing mobility parameters and utilizing this information to enable behavior change based on the Health Belief Model. We discuss examples that showcase the potential of smart home systems to not only measure but also improve mobility for community dwelling older adults.RESULTS: Mobility is a complex construct that cannot be addressed with a single monitoring approach or a single intervention. Instead, tailored interventions that address specific needs and behaviors of individuals and take into consideration preferences of older adults and potentially their social network are needed to effectively enforce positive behavior change. Smart home systems have the ability to capture details of one's daily living that could otherwise not be easily obtained; however, such data repositories alone are not sufficient to improve clinical outcomes if appropriate mechanisms for data mining and analysis, as well as tailored response systems are not in place.CONCLUSIONS: Unleashing the potential of smart home applications to measure and improve mobility has the potential of transforming elder care and providing potentially cost-effective tools to support independence for older adults. A technologically driven smart home application can maximize its clinical relevance by pursuing interactive features that can lead to behavior change.",0,0,0,1
"Computer use in older adults: Determinants and the relationship with cognitive change over a 6 year episode. Cognitively challenging activities may support the mental abilities of older adults. The use of computers and the Internet provides divergent cognitive challenges to older persons, and in previous studies, positive effects of computer and Internet use on the quality of life have been demonstrated. The present study addresses two research aims regarding predictors of computer use and the relationship between computer use and changes in cognitive abilities over a 6-year period in both younger (24-49 years) and older adults (older than 50 years). Data were obtained from an ongoing study into cognitive aging: the Maastricht Aging Study, involving 1823 normal aging adults who were followed for 9 years. The results showed age-related differences in predictors of computer use: the only predictor in younger participants was level of education, while in older participants computer use was also predicted by age, sex and feelings of loneliness. Protective effects of computer use were found for measures of selective attention and memory, in both older and younger participants. Effect sizes were small, which suggests that promotion of computer activities in older adults to prevent cognitive decline may not be an efficient strategy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of an elderly club in suburban Bangkok.. Evolution of medical technologies extent human life expectancy. The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area. To determine the mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of the Thammasat hospital elderly club which covers elderly members in northen Bangkok, Pathumthani and Ayutthaya province. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Seventy members were sampled for interview from 207 members. The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%). The sample reported poorer quality of life on 3 sub-domains of WHOQOL; physical (2.9%), psychological (1.4%) and social relationship (4.30%) domains. The level of depression, reported by those who had not enough income, was significantly higher than those who had enough income (p = 0.022). Quality of life (physical and social relationship domain) among those aged younger than 70 years, was better than that among those aged 70 or older (p = 0.024 and p = 0.023 respectively). Quality of life (psychological domain) among those who had not enough income, was significantly poorer than those with enough income (p = 0.020). Quality of life in term of social relationship was better among those living in urban areas (p = 0.037) or having better education (p = 0.014). Regular or irregular club's activity attending was not related with mental status and quality of life. The majority of the sample had equal or better mental health status and quality of life compared with the general population.

"Choosing among residential options: Results of a vignette experiment. Older people who experience declining health are often faced with difficult decisions about possible residential relocation. The research aim was to determine how five distinct dimensions-functional status, features of current housing, social networks, features of retirement communities, and financial considerations-affect decisions to relocate to a retirement community. A vignette experiment with a factorial design was conducted involving both older people and adult children who were concerned with an aging parent. Use of the Internet for administration of the experiment made it possible to deliver information to research participants through video clips. Research participants were influenced by each of the dimensions; however, functional status of the vignette persons had the greatest impact, and financial considerations the least. Adult children were more likely to recommend moves than were older people. The research is suggestive of the potential for use of vignette experiments for a fuller understanding of relocation decisions. © SAGE Publications 2012.",0,1,0,0
"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A). The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",1,0,0,0
"Health-related quality of life among elderly Member of elderly centers in Tehran. Background & Objectives: Aging and elderly population growth has been increased in Iran. Quality of life of older persons is important as a consideration in medical decisions and as a clinical outcome measure. Health related quality of life (HRQoL) is not well understood in this group therefore we designed this study to determine the quality of life among elderly populations of Tehran, Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of elderly people selected from the elderly centers in Tehran. The Iranian version of short-form Health survey (SF-36) and perceived social support questionnaires were employed as standard tools. Results: Overall, 400 elderly people with the mean age of 64.07(SD =4.49) took part in this study. Of all participants, 298 individuals were women. The mean score of PCS (Physical Component summery) and MCS (Mental Component Summery) were 64.62 (SD= 12.68) and 63.35 (SD=4/7) respectively. The results of this study revealed that women compared to men had significantly higher scores in different dimensions of health related quality of life as physical function, social function, body pain and general health. Additionally, participants with lower body mass indexes, higher education level, married elderly, healthy aged participants and richer ones had higher scores of health related quality of life. Conclusion: According to this study, there was correlation between mean PCS and social support as well as MCS and social support. Quality of life in female, individuals with higher education and socioeconomic status were higher than male, persons with lower education and socioeconomic status.",1,0,0,1

At the same time the product development is coming up to limits of affordability, limits of effectiveness and ethics. The rapid developments in the fields of social robotics and medicine as well as the urgency of the social problem turn AAL into one of the most innovative areas. The objective of this article is to explore the outcomes of interdisciplinary collaboration along the value added change including the fundamental research, product development and user inclusion site of view. The Adaptable Ambient Living ASsistant (ALIAS) project aims to develop a mobile robot system that interacts with elderly users, monitors and provides cognitive assistance in daily life, and promotes social inclusion by creating connections to people and events in the wider world. The function of ALIAS is to keep the elderly users linked to the wide society and in this way to improve their quality of life by combating loneliness and increasing cognitively stimulating activities. ALIAS is embodied by a mobile robot platform with the capacity to monitor, interact with and access information from online services, without manipulation capabilities. ALIAS is not designed to replace human-human contacts, but rather, to enhance and promote these through the proposed wide range of integrated services. By serving as a monitor, a cognitive-prosthetic device and a facilitator of social contacts, the ALIAS system will significantly improve the daily life of elderly people. The ALIAS-project is characterized by a close cooperation of social scientist and engineers. The teams exchange information permanently and an interdisciplinary work of high quality is ensured. There is a permanent feedback between social and technical work packages. The objective is to develop a robot platform that adjusts to the individual wishes and needs of the elderly people. For this purpose the users have been involved at a very early stage of the project. Thus the research Area ""Gender Studies in Science"" has conducted inquiries, workshops and interviews with different user groups (e.g. seniors, relatives, caregivers and care consultants) and has realized a secondary analysis. The results of the investigations are fed back to the technical partners and have been incorporated into the development of the ALIAS platform. To provide technical solutions that are tailored to the requirements of the user groups a close cooperation in the overall project is necessary. That means the research teams also learn from the feedback of users. It is important, that the issues of the project are an inherent part in the work with elderly, of the interdisciplinary work between the teams in the project and also part of the engineering education, because the experiences and the results of ALIAS integrated in the engineering education. At the SEFI conference the very early involvement of different user groups in the development process and the results of the conducted inquiries as well as the technical implementation of the mobile robot platform should be highlighted and discussed with the conference attendees.",1,0,0,0
"Turkish senior's perspective and utilization of mobile phones. Mobile phone is now common personal item for various users. Users show a broad variety of behaviors when they deal with new technological equipment. They may completely reject them, may only partially use selected functions or users may completely accept the technology and the functions provided. Mobile phones can have a significant role in assisting older people in terms of providing a sense of security, and maintaining social relationships. This study investigated the use of mobile phones by Turkish people who are aged over 60 years. Although it is currently well known that older adults are accepted as the passive users for mobile phones, there is a limited amount of research related to the seniors. In this study, the basic preferences such as color, model, and mobile operator of the elderly were gathered initially. The concerns and the reasons of using mobile phone were identified. As the primary experiment, the relationship between six measures; life satisfaction, self-efficacy, mobile phone anxiety, mobile phone attitude, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use were examined by surveying the participants. The results were analyzed and compared by three factors: gender, education, and income. The correlations between the measures were also identified. The performance of the elderly with mobile phone task completion efficiency and effectiveness was also studied. Also, better mobile phone adoption methods for the elderly should be proposed. © 2011 AICIT.",1,0,0,0
"Secure handshake with symptoms-matching: The essential to the success of mhealthcare social network. In our aging society, mHealthcare social network (MHSN) built upon wireless body sensor network (WBSN) and mobile communications provides a promising platform for the seniors who have the same symptom to exchange their experiences, give mutual support and inspiration to each other, and help forwarding their health information wirelessly to a related eHealth center. However, there exist many challenging security issues in MHSN such as how to securely identify a senior who has the same symptom, how to prevent others who don't have the symptom from knowing someone's symptom? In this paper, to tackle these challenging security issues, we propose a secure same-symptom-based handshake (SSH) scheme, and apply the provable security technique to demonstrate its security in the random oracle model. In addition, we discuss a promising application - social-based patient health information (PHI) collaborative reporting in MHSN, and conduct extensive simulations to evaluate its efficiency in terms of PHI reporting delay. © 2010 ACM.",0,0,0,0
"A TV Platform to improve older people.'s quality of life: Lessons learned from the evaluation of the VITAL project with Spanish Elderly Users. The User Centered Design allows the technical developers to know specific characteristics about the potential end users. In the specific case of elderly users, consideration of their needs in areas like communication, family and social relationships, social support and leisure, is a key point, which should guide the development of technological applications. In an attempt to fulfill to some extent this range of needs, the VITAL project, which is a European Community 6th Framework Program financed project, has developed a set of technologies, platforms and applications with the aim to provide remote assistance to elderly users and increase their quality of life The sample recruited for the last evaluation of VITAL in Spain was composed of 83 participants, 19 male and 64 female, with an age ranging from 52 to 91 (x=73,68, sd=7,86). All targeted users were attending elder associations in their respective cities, which implies an existing minimum social interaction for all for them. This paper gathers the literature about elderly needs in the areas of communication with family, social relationships and leisure, and examines what elderly users think about how VITAL Platform can help them in improving their quality of life in those addressed areas. © 2011 ACM.",0,0,0,0
"The MOvIT project phase I: Designing a mobility device monitoring intervention with end-users and healthcare providers. Objective. The purpose of the Mobility Outcomes via Information Technologies (MOvIT) project is to optimize the mobility and community participation of older wheelchair users by systematically monitoring patient reported outcomes following a wheelchair prescription using an interactive voice response system (IVRS). One of the challenges in designing computerized automated calls was to maximize the acceptability of the monitoring intervention for middle-aged and older wheelchair users, and to consider the perceptions of the clinicians who provide the intervention. Thus, the phase I objectives of MOvIT were to customize the IVRS monitoring intervention for both groups of users. Main Content. An iterative user-centered design involved end-users during the development process to receive input about perceived usefulness and ease of use. A single investigator presented the IVRS prototype during individual interviews with 7 wheelchair users and 4 healthcare providers identified by 3 rehabilitation centers. To expose a maximum of age-friendly design issues, a majority of WC users were aged >70 years; healthcare providers had experience in geriatrics and wheelchair prescription. The prototype comprised 2 screening calls after wheelchair delivery, a reminder call to make an appointment for servicing, daily electronic notifications to a clinical coordinator listing cases to call back. Each individual tried 4 different IVRS audio scenarios, followed by a semi-structured interview adapted from the After-scenario Questionnaire and Post-Study Systems Usability Questionnaire. Results. The MOvIT questionnaire addresses eight WC-related adverse events: non-use of the WC, presence of pain, skin problem, positioning problem, WC tipping/falls, WC accidents, psychosocial, and mechanical problems. New concepts emerged, the most important being caregiver and psychosocial issues. Moreover, the conceptualization of the environment was simplified. To ensure ease of use, a number of adaptive strategies were implemented in the prototype such as choice of voice, words and expressions, response options, quantity of information in each step, timing of automated calls based on clinical relevance and a realistic callback delay. Conclusion. The involvement of end-users led to fundamental changes to tailor the monitoring IVRS intervention for the older population and to insure fit with clinical practice. Our results highlight the need for support following a WC intervention, especially for older adults who receive no formal rehabilitation program. Acknowledgements.

"Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice. Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.",1,0,0,1
"A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology. Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.",1,0,0,1
"A quality-of-life scale for assistive technology: Results of a pilot study of aging and technology. Background. In an aging society, it is increasingly important to understand how assistive devices can be used by older people to maintain quality of life despite chronic disabilities. Assistive technology is a mainstay of physical therapist practice, but the potential for device use to affect psychosocial well-being is not yet understood at the population level. Objective. The objective of this study was to develop a parsimonious indicator that can be used in population-based surveys to represent the effect of assistive technologies on quality of life for older people, separate from personal assistance. Design. This study was a cross-sectional survey. Methods. The methods used in this study were psychometric scale development and structural equation modeling. Results. The results indicated that a parsimonious, valid, and reliable scale reflecting quality of life related to assistive device use can be created from 3 questions designed to measure improvements in safety, control, and participation due to technology. The findings also suggested that assistive technology may more effectively improve quality of life for people with greater levels of functional limitations. Limitations. The data were derived from a cross-sectional survey conducted by telephone. The use of personal assistance, on average, was low; thus, the applicability to a population with more profound care needs has yet to be confirmed. Conclusions. Determining the broader impact of assistive technology on quality of life with population-level measures may provide insight into how best to leverage technologies to prevent dependence in aging adults. © 2011 American Physical Therapy Association.",1,0,0,1
"The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly. Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.",1,1,1,1
"Examining age and experience differences in use of knowledge in the world in everyday technology interactions. Competence in technology use during everyday activities is required for continued independence of older adults, and rapid technological changes have made effective design of learning support beyond formal training crucial to maintain this competence. Older adults have reported a preference for specific training and text manuals when they learn to use technologies, but no research has systematically examined what is actually used in everyday life. This study examined age and experience differences in the use of external support (knowledge in the world) over a ten day period. Interviews with participants about technology encounters during this period were analyzed. Three categories of knowledge in the world were identified: social support, instruction, and ondevice information. Age differences were found in use of social support and instruction. Age and experience differences were found in use of on-device information. These results confirm the importance of good instructional support for older adults that accommodates age-related declines and differences in specific knowledge. Data also suggest that development of a simple and reliable method for older adults to obtain social support may help low technology older adults to more effectively use everyday technologies and to resolve problems.

"The contribution of home-based technology to older people's quality of life in extra care housing. Abstract. Background: British government policy for older people focuses on a vision of active ageing and independent living. In the face of diminishing personal capacities, the use of appropriate home-based technology (HBT) devices could potentially meet a wide range of needs and consequently improve many aspects of older people's quality of life such as physical health, psychosocial well-being, social relationships, and their physical or living environment. This study aimed to examine the use of HBT devices and the correlation between use of such devices and quality of life among older people living in extra-care housing (ECH). Methods. A structured questionnaire was administered for this study. Using purposive sampling 160 older people living in extra-care housing schemes were selected from 23 schemes in England. A face-to-face interview was conducted in each participant's living unit. In order to measure quality of life, the SEIQoL-Adapted and CASP-19 were used. Results: Although most basic appliances and emergency call systems were used in the living units, communally provided facilities such as personal computers, washing machines, and assisted bathing equipment in the schemes were not well utilised. Multiple regression analysis adjusted for confounders including age, sex, marital status, living arrangement and mobility use indicated a coefficient of 1.17 with 95% CI (0.05, 2.29) and p = 0.04 [SEIQoL-Adapted] and 2.83 with 95% CI (1.17, 4.50) and p = 0.001 [CASP-19]. Conclusions: The findings of the present study will be value to those who are developing new form of specialised housing for older people with functional limitations and, in particular, guiding investments in technological aids. The results of the present study also indicate that the home is an essential site for developing residential technologies. © 2011Matlabi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",1,0,0,1
"Predictors of computer use in community-dwelling, ethnically diverse older adults. Objective: In this study, we analyzed self-reported computer use, demographic variables, psychosocial variables, and health and well-being variables collected from 460 ethnically diverse, community-dwelling elders to investigate the relationship computer use has with demographics, well-being, and other key psychosocial variables in older adults.Background: Although younger elders with more education, those who employ active coping strategies, or those who are low in anxiety levels are thought to use computers at higher rates than do others, previous research has produced mixed or inconclusive results regarding ethnic, gender, and psychological factors or has concentrated on computer-specific psychological factors only (e.g., computer anxiety). Few such studies have employed large sample sizes or have focused on ethnically diverse populations of community-dwelling elders.Method: With a large number of overlapping predictors, zero-order analysis alone is poorly equipped to identify variables that are independently associated with computer use. Accordingly, both zero-order and stepwise logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the correlates of two types of computer use: e-mail and general computer use.Results: Results indicate that younger age, greater level of education, non-Hispanic ethnicity, behaviorally active coping style, general physical health, and role-related emotional health each independently predicted computer usage.Conclusion: Study findings highlight differences in computer usage, especially in regard to Hispanic ethnicity and specific health and well-being factors.Application: Potential applications of this research include future intervention studies, individualized computer-based activity programming, or customizable software and user interface design for older adults responsive to a variety of personal characteristics and capabilities. © 2011, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",1,0,0,1
"Prevalence and correlates of elder mistreatment in South Carolina: The South Carolina elder mistreatment study. The purposes of this study were to (a) derive prevalence estimates for elder mistreatment (emotional, physical, sexual, neglectful, and financial mistreatment of older adults [age 60 +]) in a randomly selected sample of South Carolinians; (b) examine correlates (i.e., potential risk factors) of mistreatment; and (c) examine incident characteristics of mistreatment events. Random Digit Dialing (RDD) was used to derive a representative sample in terms of age and gender; computer-assisted telephone interviewing was used to standardize collection of demographic, correlate, and mistreatment data. Prevalence estimates and mistreatment correlates were obtained and subjected to logistic regression. A total of 902 participants provided data. Prevalence for mistreatment types (since age 60) were 12.9% emotional, 2.1% physical, 0.3% sexual, 5.4% potential neglect, and 6.6% financial exploitation by family member. The most consistent correlates of mistreatment across abuse types were low social support and needing assistance with daily living activities. One in 10 participants reported either emotional, physical, sexual, or neglectful mistreatment within the past year, and 2 in 10 reported mistreatment since age 60. Across categories, the most consistent correlate of mistreatment was low social support, representing an area toward which preventive intervention may be directed with significant public health implications. © The Author(s) 2011.",1,0,0,0
"Effects of Playing Wii on Well-Being in the Elderly: Physical Activity, Loneliness, and Mood. Effects of compensatory strategies offered by Wii technology on physical activity, loneliness, and mood are investigated. Thirty-five individuals (M = 82 years) were randomly assigned to either playing Wii or watching television with a partner for 10 weeks. Physical activity, loneliness, mood, life satisfaction, and health were assessed. The elderly playing Wii had lower loneliness and a pattern of greater positive mood compared to the television group. No differences in life satisfaction or physical activity were found, but loneliness predicted positive mood, and positive mood predicted physical activity. This investigation points to the benefits of using Wii for well-being, particularly social connection and enjoyment. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",1,1,1,0
"breaking the fourth wall': 3d virtual worlds as tools for knowledge repatriation in archaeology. Interactive 3-dimensional worlds and computer modeling can be used to excite interest in archaeology among indigenous groups such as the Inuit of the North American Arctic and Greenland. Using two case studies - a recently completed exhibition for the Virtual Museum of Canada on Thule Inuit whalebone houses and an interactive virtual world structured around the Siglit-Inuvialuit sod house - we explore how digital replicas might be used in the repatriation of traditional knowledge. This idea is examined through theexperiences of nine Inuit Elders who explored our digital reconstructions of Thule and Siglit-Inuvialuit dwellings in 3D. Discussions with the Elders suggest that the generic sense of 'presence' generated by 3D viewing enhanced their feelings of connectedness to their past. This would imply that virtual reality and 3D technology might be useful in establishing new discourses in archaeological interpretation, as well as assisting in the exploration, construction, and maintenance of cultural identities through knowledge repatriation. © The Author(s) 2011.",0,0,0,0
"Designing a web-based telehealth system for elderly people: An interview study in New Zealand. Designing healthcare systems for the elderly is a challenging endeavour. Telehealth systems are gaining popularity among elderly users, but such applications are mostly doctor-centric and are predominantly used for managing and/or treating diseases instead of preventing them. They do little to motivate patients to change their lifestyle and proactively manage their health. To address these shortcomings, we propose a web-based telehealth system, which uses Web 2.0 technologies in order to add social support and user defined content. In this study, we determine the functional and interface requirements of the system by conducting open individual semi-structured interviews with eight elderly people of age range 60 to 87. A paper prototype and three interfaces of existing Web 2.0 health applications were used to determine the optimum user interface design of the system. A qualitative content analysis was used to evaluate the responses. Overall, the respondents were positive about the idea of using the web to manage their healthcare from home and made several suggestions such as including applications to manage their diet, physiotherapy exercises to improve their health conditions and simple network games to reduce loneliness. © 2011 IEEE.",1,0,0,0
"Turning older people's experiences into innovations: Ippi as the convergence of mobile services and TV viewing. This paper presents the results of a research project in which a patented system for asynchronous communication ('ippi') is used as the basis for a prototype communication device utilizing the participants' televisions as the primary interface. The aim was to study the extent to which older people's lifelong experiences watching TV reduced their uncertainty when faced with TV-based applications. The study examined the factors that explained participants' continued use of the application. The implementation and testing of the system was structured as an iterative design process including conceptual development, a six-month test period in the homes of eleven users with usability tests and interviews, monthly focus groups and information gathered by a back-up function that also provided the users with immediate help with the technology if necessary. The results show that while the use of TV as a metaphor or platform succeeded in getting the older users to try out and use the ippi prototype, it did not contribute primarily to using the ippi on a daily basis during the test period. Rather, participants' access to a social context or a social network determined the extent of usage. There was a difference between what was easy to use in terms of the interface, and what was easy and worth using in a social everyday context on the other. In order to be used, a new product of this type must add value and that value depends upon integration into daily communication.",1,1,1,0
"Intergenerational telementoring for the promotion of social relationships. Videoconferencing via PCs and the Internet may provide a powerful medium through which seniors can interact with and develop relationships with youth. The PACE 2000 International Foundation has developed accessible, reliable and easy-to-use solutions that bring both senior and youth communities together for their mutual benefit. In this study, 18 older adults aged 70±7 years, provided second-language coaching to 18 young people (nine students and nine unemployed youth), via the videoconference based Intergenerational Telementoring Station® accessible to people having restrictions. Evaluation was based on the systems server logs capturing user log-in and log-out data, as well as entry and final questionnaire data from participants and supporting staff. The results of these two pilot studies indicate that videoconference based telementorship programs may successfully expand their recruitment beyond the conventional student-mentee and adult-mentors' populations. Older adults, including people with restrictions, exhibited higher motivation and compliance rates compared to unemployed youth. All participants (youth and seniors) highly valued the program (average rating over 80%), particularly its inter-cultural aspects as well as the relationships they developed. Eighty-six percent of youth reported that they benefitted from the second language immersion experience via videoconference. Positive behavioral shifts were observed after only 2 to 4 sessions, and these can provide a starting point for further research. We conclude that customized videoconference based telementoring provides a positive and motivational experience, which exceeds the scope of typical conventional mentoring programs (i.e. target populations enrollment, interaction types, geographic independence, etc).",1,1,1,0
"The Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long term Evaluation of Survivorship registry: Scope, rationale and design of an infrastructure for the study of physical and psychosocial outcomes in cancer survivorship cohorts. Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial treatment and Long term Evaluation of Survivorship (PROFILES)' is a registry for the study of the physical and psychosocial impact of cancer and its treatment from a dynamic, growing population-based cohort of both short and long-term cancer survivors. PROFILES contains a large web-based component and are linked directly to clinical data from the population-based Eindhoven cancer registry. This paper describes the rationale and design of PROFILES. The primary aims of studies that use the PROFILES registry are: (1) psychosocial risk and outcome assessment to identify patients at high risk for poor physical and mental health outcomes, (2) to analyse mediating mechanisms to better understand the biological and behavioural factors associated with cancer treatment outcomes, and (3) to evaluate physical and psychosocial care needs of cancer survivors. PROFILES is a tool that enables data collection management; from inviting patients to participation in studies, to collecting patient-reported outcomes data via web-based or mailed questionnaires and linking these data with clinical data. The availability of a control cohort of approximately 2000 persons from the general population who complete the same basic questionnaire annually will provide the opportunity to estimate the unique impact of cancer, beyond that of normal ageing and comorbidities. Raw data from the PROFILES registry will be available for non-commercial scientific research, subject to study question, privacy and confidentiality restrictions, and registration (www. profilesregistry.nl). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

"Psychosocial and functional correlates of nutrition among community-dwelling older adults in Ireland. objectives: to examine psychosocial and functional correlates of nutrition in a nonrandom sample of irish community-dwelling older adults. Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting: technology Research for independent Living (tRiL) Clinic, a comprehensive geriatric assessment facility in st James's hospital, Dublin. Data were collected from participants by medical personnel (physical assessments) and psychologists (questionnaires), between August 2007 and may 2009. Participants: 556 participants (388 females; 168 males) ranging in age from 60-92 years (mean 72.5 years, sD 7.1). All were community-dwelling and provided informed consent. Measurements: the nestlé mini-nutritional Assessment (mnA®), time to get up and go (tug) and the Lubben social network scale-18 (Lsns-18) were used to assess nutrition, functional mobility and social support. Methods: multivariate binary logistic regression was used to examine the association between social support or mobility and nutritional status, whilst controlling for possible confounders (age, gender, living alone and material deprivation). Results: the strongest predictors of abnormal nutritional status were mobility (p < 0.001) and social support (p = 0.005). other significant predictors of nutritional risk were age (p = 0.032) and deprivation (p = 0.018). Conclusion: the results emphasise the importance of mobility and social supports in mediating nutritional outcomes in irish community-dwelling older adults.",1,0,0,1
"The Long-Term Efficacy of Two Computer-Tailored Physical Activity Interventions for Older Adults: Main Effects and Mediators. Objective: Low-cost (e.g., computer-tailored) interventions with sustained effects are needed to increase and maintain physical activity in older adults. This study examined the long-term efficacy of 2 computer-tailored physical activity interventions for older adults and its psychosocial and environmental mediators. Methods: A clustered randomized controlled trial (N = 1,971) was conducted that included 3 research arms: (a) basic computer-tailored print intervention, targeting psychosocial mediators; (b) environmentally computer-tailored print intervention, targeting psychosocial and environmental mediators; and (c) no-intervention control group. Interventions were developed using the intervention mapping approach and consisted of 3 computer-tailored letters delivered over 4 months. Questionnaires assessed the study outcomes (i.e., total weekly days and total weekly minutes of physical activity) at baseline and 12 months. Potential mediators (i.e., awareness, attitude, self-efficacy, intention, social influence, intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and perceived environment) were assessed at baseline and at 3 or 6 months. Results: Multilevel regression analyses revealed that both interventions significantly changed total weekly days of physical activity compared with the control group, but only the environmentally computer-tailored print intervention significantly changed weekly minutes of physical activity. Multiple mediation models showed that the effects of both interventions on weekly days of physical activity were mediated by changes in awareness and intention. Conclusions: Computer-tailored interventions were effective in inducing long-term behavioral changes in physical activity behavior of older adults. Awareness and intention were found to be important mediators of changing daily physical activity and should be included in future computer-tailored intervention studies. © 2011 American Psychological Association.",1,1,1,1
"Development and pilot testing of a self-management internet-based program for older adults with overactive bladder. Objectives: To implement and pilot test our Self-Management Internet-Based Program for Older Adults with Overactive Bladder (OAB-SMIP) in a group of older adults with overactive bladder (OAB) to determine its usability and outcomes, including knowledge, self-efficacy, perception of bladder condition, and health-related quality of life. Methods: In a single-group study design with pre- and post-tests, we recruited 25 men and women age 55 or older with symptoms of OAB. The OAB-SMIP intervention consisted of 3 multimedia e-learning tutorials, social networking features, and other online resources delivered over 6 weeks. Results: Participants enjoyed the OAB-SMIP and found it easy to use. Participants demonstrated increased knowledge (SMD = 4.17, large effect size), and their symptoms improved after the intervention (SMD = 1.20-1.30, large effect sizes). Participants improved their overall self-efficacy (SMD = 1.84, large effect size) as well as their self-efficacy in performing pelvic muscle exercises (SMD = 1.41, large effect size) and controlling urge symptoms (SMD = 1.32, large effect size), and there were significant increases in health-related quality of life (SMD = 1.13, large effect size) after exposure to the OAB-SMIP. We did not find any significant gender differences. Conclusions: Participants using the OAB-SMIP improved their knowledge, symptoms, self-efficacy in performing pelvic muscle exercises and overall management of OAB, as well as health-related quality-of-life scores. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",0,1,0,1
"Living with pain, staying in touch: Exploring the communication needs of older adults with chronic pain. For older adults with chronic pain, maintaining social ties can be difficult. Both chronic pain and social isolation compound each other and are associated with poor health outcomes. Our research explores how technology can be used to facilitate communication and support for older adults with chronic pain. We report on preliminary results of field research with 20 participants and deployment of a digital communicating picture frame prototype. We found that chronic pain introduces unique barriers to synchronous contact and that our prototype seemed to fit the needs of these individuals by supporting meaningful asynchronous communication with the possibility for adjustable reciprocity.",1,1,1,0
"Retirees on facebook: Can online social networking enhance their health and wellness?. An individual's social network has a strong impact on his or her mental and physical health. This is of particular consequence for senior citizens who are at greater risk of social isolation after retirement, due to loss of spouse, mobility issues, and recent emphasis on aging in place, i.e., in smart homes. Can online social networking sites (SNSs) such as Facebook help alleviate social isolation of aging alone by enabling seniors to maintain high-quality social interactions? How can we make senior-friendly design improvements to SNSs? A preliminary national survey (N=168) of adults over 55 revealed that for those who had joined an SNS, the primary motivation cited for signing up was persuasion by a friend or family member, while nonusers cited a strong lack of interest rather than a lack of knowledge or skill, with implications for theory and design of SNS technology for senior citizens.",0,0,0,0
"Internet use and psychological wellness during late adulthood. An aging population is best served by social, personal, and health support focused on maintaining and maximizing personal independence. The Internet affords numerous opportunities for individuals of all ages to communicate, access information, and engage in recreational activities. A community-based sample of 122 adults over 60 years of age completed a questionnaire which assessed three clusters of characteristics: (a) frequency and patterns of Internet use, (b) well-being (loneliness, life satisfaction, self-efficacy, social support, and depression), and (c) demographics (age, income, education). Significant correlations emerged between the three clusters of measured variables. Controlling for demographic differences, Internet use and self-efficacy remained significantly related. Among the sample of older adults, individuals who used the Internet more had higher perceptions of self-efficacy than those who used the Internet rarely or not at all. © 2011 Canadian Association on Gerontology.",1,0,0,0
"Mobile remote presence systems for older adults: Acceptance, benefits, and concerns. While much of human-robot interaction research focuses upon people interacting with autonomous robots, there is also much to be gained from exploring human interpersonal interaction through robots. The current study focuses on mobile remote presence (MRP) systems as used by a population who could potentially benefit from more social connectivity and communication with remote people -older adults. Communication technologies are important for ensuring safety, independence, and social support for older adults, thereby potentially improving their quality of life and maintaining their independence [24]. However, before such technologies would be accepted and used by older adults, it is critical to understand their perceptions of the benefits, concerns, and adoption criteria for MRP systems. As such, we conducted a needs assessment with twelve volunteer participants (ages 63-88), who were given first-hand experience with both meeting a visitor via the MRP system and driving the MRP system to visit that person. The older adult participants identified benefits such as being able to see and be seen via the MRP system, reducing travel costs and hassles, and reducing social isolation. Among the concerns identified were etiquette of using the MRP, personal privacy, and overuse of the system. Some new use-cases were identified that have not yet been explored in prior work, for example, going to museums, attending live performances, and visiting friends who are hospitalized. The older adults in the current study preferred to operate the MRP themselves, rather than to be visited by others operating the MRP system. More findings are discussed in terms of their implications for design.",1,0,0,0
"Social Roles in an Online Support Community for Older People. In this article, an online support community for older people is studied, with the aim of developing a taxonomy of social roles based on content analysis and social network analysis. Four hundred messages (posted between August 9, 2007, and February 5, 2008) in an online support community for older people (urlhttp://www.seniornet.org/url) were investigated. The data were analyzed to identify and shed light on patterns of the online functional behavior as well as the social structure of active members. Drawing on the findings, a set of six social roles were identified, defined, and described in depth. The findings showed that the structural positions of online community members were associated with the kind of content these members tended to post. For example, it was found that central members were very likely to give support, whereas members not very well connected were more inclined to post self-disclosing messages. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0,0,0,0
"Country of origin predicts nutrition risk among community living older people. Objectives: To assess the nutrition risk status of community living older people and to identify associated risk factors. Design: A cross-sectional study using convenience sampling. Setting: North Shore City, Auckland, New Zealand. Data collection was carried out by a research nutritionist using computer assisted personal interviewing in the participant's own home. Participants: Fifty-one independently living people aged between 80 and 85 years. Measurement: A survey using three validated questionnaires: Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) to evaluate social networks; Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing and Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) to assess nutrition risk. Results: A third of the participants (31%) were at high risk of malnutrition (SCREEN II score <50; range 29-58 out of maximum score of 64). The majority of participants (82%) lived alone and nearly half (47%) had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. Low self-rated health, disability and social factors (being born outside of New Zealand, losing a spouse and loneliness) were key underlying factors associated with being at nutrition risk. Conclusion: Nutrition risk is common among aged individuals living in the community. Health and social factors that shape eating behaviours place older people at increased nutrition risk. Strategies are needed for the early identification of risk factors to prevent nutrition problems. Engaging older people at risk to share meal preparation and dining experiences may foster better outcomes. © 2011 Serdi and Springer Verlag France.",1,0,0,1
"Factors associated with self-rated benzodiazepine addiction among community-dwelling seniors. Long-term use of benzodiazepines carries considerable personal consequences such as memory loss and functional impairment. In addition, use over time may bring about dependence and habituation thus leading older persons to believe they cannotdiscontinue the drug and to experience withdrawal symptoms should its use suddenly cease. The frequency of such negative consequences remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of self-rated addiction among older persons and its associated factors. Face-to-face computer-assisted interviews were conducted in the homes of 2,785 persons aged 65 years and over, randomly selected from across the Province of Quebec, Canada. Of the 707 users of benzodiazepines, 43% considered themselves addicted. They were more likely to be 75 years or over, to suffer from panic disorder, to believe that health professionals are ready and available to discuss emotional problems with them, and to be less than satisfied with their social relationships. This study showed that a large proportion of benzodiazepine users rated themselves as addicted. These findings indicate that it is important for nurses to screen older adults living in the community to identify those who continue to use benzodiazepine beyond the recommended therapeutic time frame, perceive themselves to be dependent, and could potentially benefit from participation in a withdrawal program. © 2011 International Nurses Society on Addictions.",1,0,0,0
"Technology and aging project: Training outcomes and efficacy from a randomized field trial. This study examined whether training provided to adults age 60+ would increase the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as email and the Internet, and influence participants' social support and mental health. Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (n = 45) or a control group (n = 38). The experimental group participated in a six-month training program. Data were collected before, during, and after training on outcomes related to computer use, social support, and mental health. Mixed regression models were used for multivariate analyses. Compared to the control group, the experimental group reported greater self-efficacy in executing computer-related tasks and used more ICTs, perceived greater social support from friends, and reported significantly higher quality of life. Computer self-efficacy had both a direct and indirect effect on ICT use, but not on other variables. With appropriate training, older adults want to and can learn the skills needed to use ICTs. Older adults with ICT skills can access online sources of information regarding Medicare Part D options and utilize patient portals associated with electronic medical records. Agencies may develop services that build upon this technology sophistication, but policies also will need to address issues of access to equipment and high-speed Internet service. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",1,1,1,0
"The use of telephone befriending in low level support for socially isolated older people - an evaluation. There is increasing policy recognition that the alleviation of social isolation and loneliness in older people should be prioritised. Recently, technology, such as telephone networks and the Internet, has received attention in supporting isolated and lonely older people. Despite lack of evidence, telephone befriending has been considered an effective low-level method to decrease loneliness among older people. This study evaluated the impact of a national befriending scheme for isolated and/or lonely older people, involving eight project sites across the UK 2007-2008. The purpose was to assess the impact of different models of telephone-based befriending services on older people's health and well-being. A mixed methods approach was used. This paper reports on the findings from 40 in-depth interviews with older service recipients. The most important finding was that the service helped older people to gain confidence, re-engage with the community and become socially active again. Three topics were identified: why older people valued the service, what impact it had made on their health and well-being and what they wanted from the service. In addition, nine subthemes emerged: life is worth living, gaining a sense of belonging, knowing they had a friend, a healthy mind is a healthy body, the alleviation of loneliness and anxiety, increased self-confidence, ordinary conversation, a trusted and reliable service, the future - giving something back. In conclusion, the findings present in-depth qualitative evidence of the impact of telephone befriending on older people's well-being. Befriending schemes provide low-cost means for socially isolated older people to become more confident and independent and develop a sense of self-respect potentially leading to increased participation and meaningful relationships. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",1,0,0,0

"Attitudes toward online social connection and self-disclosure as predictors of facebook communication and relational closeness. This investigation tested a theoretical model of communication behavior with specific Facebook friends, such that attitudes toward (a) online self-disclosure, and (b) online social connection, predict Facebook communication frequency and, in turn, relational closeness. Participants included both undergraduates and older adults. Results generally supported the model, with the interaction effect between self-disclosure and social connection directly predicting Facebook communication and indirectly predicting relational closeness. For both dependent variables, online social connection was a positive predictor at low and moderate levels of online self-disclosure, but high levels reduced the association to nonsignificance. One implication of these results was that high-warrant information may discourage those with social anxiety from social network site communication. © The Author(s) 2011.",0,0,0,0
"Lessened decline in physical activity and impairment of older adults with diabetes with telemedicine and pedometer use: Results from the IDEATel study. Objective: to examine the effects of the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) telemedicine intervention and pedometer use on physical activity (PA) and impairment in older adults with diabetes. Design: randomised clinical trial. Subjects ethnically diverse medically underserved Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes (n= 1,650). Methods: participants received home videovisits with a diabetes educator every 4-6 weeks or usual care. All received a pedometer. Annual measurements included hemoglobin A1c, Comprehensive Assessment and Referral Evaluation Activities of Daily Living, Diabetes Self-Care Activities, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Luben Social Support and pedometer use. Mixed model analyses were performed using random effects to adjust for clustering within primary care physicians. Results: in the telemedicine group compared with the usual care group, the rate of decline in PA (P= 0.0128) and physical impairment (PI) (P= 0.0370) was significantly less over time. Significant mean endpoint differences were observed for PA (P= 0.003). Pedometer use was significantly associated with PA (P= 0.0006) and PI (P< 0.0001). Baseline characteristics associated with greater PA included having fewer comorbid conditions (P= 0.0054), less depression (P< 0.0001), more social networking (P< 0.0001), lower BMI (P< 0.0001), male gender (P< 0.0001) and lower hemoglobin A1c level (P= 0.0045). Similar predictors were observed for PI, except duration of diabetes also predicted increased impairment (P< 0.0001). Significant indirect effects were observed through use of the pedometer on reduced decline in PA (P= 0.0024, 0.0013) and PI (P= 0.0024, P< 0.0001). Conclusions: this telemedicine intervention reduced rates of decline in PA and impairment in older adults with diabetes. Pedometers may be a helpful inexpensive adjunct to diabetes initiatives delivered remotely with emerging technologies.

"Objective measurement of sociability and activity: Mobile sensing in the community. PURPOSE Automated systems able to infer detailed measures of a person's social interactions and physical activities in their natural environments could lead to better understanding of factors infl uencing well-being. We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04). CONCLUSIONS Mobile sensing of sociability and activity is well correlated with traditional measures and less prone to biases associated with questionnaires that rely on recall. Using mobile devices to collect data from and monitor older adult patients has the potential to improve detection of changes in their health.",1,0,0,1
"Identifying requirements and features for communications systems between older people in care settings. Care settings for older people, such as nursing homes, can have low levels of social interaction, which has been shown in many studies as being crucial to both the mental and physical well-being of older adults. Furthermore, increased social interaction has been shown to have a positive effect on adjustment in institutions for the aged. However, these social connections can be lost due to movement within the care system, with residents regularly relocating for a variety of reasons including cost and medical issues. Eleven health professionals and six residents living in a care home in Ireland were interviewed about their social activities and levels of engagement within the home. Storyboards were then developed and presented to the residents based on these interviews. Findings from the interviews indicate that activity levels among the more cognitively able residents are quite low due to activities catering for the less able residents. Furthermore, a lack of access to information and resources (such as books and newspapers) means that these more able residents reported experiencing long periods of boredom. Technology can potentially allow residents access to such information and resources, enabling them to pursue activities in their personal time which can then also be used as the basis for group discussions. The use of technology could, in addition, allow those residents who had moved out of the home to continue to participate and collaborate in activities with the other residents. © 2010 IEEE.",1,0,0,0
"Physical and psychosocial effects of Wii video game use among older women. This study investigated the physical and psychosocial effect of exergaming in community dwelling older adult women. In a pilot study consisting of a six-week baseline period and a six-week intervention period, participants (N = 11, mean age = 73.5 years, SD = 9.0) played Nintendo Wii Sports twice weekly. We measured full body movements using accelerometers, and assessed psychosocial effects through end-of-study focus group meetings. There were large self-reported psychological effects related to positive changes in self perception. The game-play deepened social connections within the group and provided a basis for shared experiences with younger aged family members. Physically, the game-play showed significantly higher maximum energy expenditure (t = -4.52, p < 0.05) than baseline, but no significant difference in overall energy expenditure. Findings from the quantitative data showed that Wii-play did not have substantial physical effects; nevertheless, qualitative data revealed that the participants perceived an improved sense of physical, social and psychological wellbeing. © International Journal of Emerging Technologies and Society 2010.",1,1,1,0
"Internet integration possibilities for Turkish youth in Vienna: Online games and digital friendships [Integrationspotenziale des Internets für türkische Jugendliche in Wien am Beispiel von Online-Spielen und digitalen Freundschaftsnetzwerken]. Based on a cohort of young Austrians of Turkish descent, this paper links the debate on the integration of the second generation (or the lack thereof) with the controversial discourse about the potential usefulness and risks of new media and technologies, specifically the Internet. Various studies have concluded either that the new media and technologies are positive integrative aspects of the society or have devastating impacts on different groups. On the one hand, the Internet allows young people to discover new experiences and gain additional often unorthodox knowledge; on the other hand, observers have warned about the segregating effects of new technologies. A „digital divide“ has been opened between privileged users and the underprivileged masses, according to these more cautious voices. This divide has caused social deprivation and disintegration amongst the most vulnerable groups, in particular, older people, economically insecure groups and immigrants. Thus, various media life-styles establish a continuum between a media and information elite on the one end and the entertainment under-class on the other. Semi structured interviews with young Turks in Vienna show the positive and negative effects of playing Online Role Playing Games on the Internet in opposition to so-called Social Network Sites such as Netlog. © 2010, VS Verlag f�r Sozialwissenschaften.",0,0,0,0
"Female social control in the late soviet village: Comrades? courts as a nexus of official and customary justice (based on field materials from northwestern russia). This paper results from our project on rural comrades' courts, a case study based on field materials from northwestern Russia (village of Shola, Belozer-skii district, Vologda region).1 The time frame of the research is the 1960-80s, when Nikita Khrushchev returned to Lenin's ""utopian"" model of political development, also known as the ""withering away of the state."" According to Khrushchev's plan, comrades' courts, ""resurrected"" after several decades of virtual death, were supposed to become the primary institution of teaching the ""wide masses of the working people"" what political participation means, as well as turn into ""conductors"" of Soviet ideology at the grassroots level of society. In reality this meant an effort to introduce yet another form of all-embracing control over all layers of the population. We argue that in spite of this official legitimization, comrades' courts embodied a nexus of official and customary justice where ordinary people could exercise practices of traditional conflict resolution under the guise of legal procedures imposed from above. The gist of the idea of comradely justice is that the role of judges is played by the people who know the offender well-e.g., who work with him/her at the same enterprise or live with the offender in the same house or neighborhood. The aim of comradely justice was not so much to punish as to raise the moral level, not only of the guilty party, but of all members of the Soviet ""collective. "" Public opinion in all of its forms (reprimand, criticism, warning, etc.) was the major sanction of the comrades' court, although it could also impose minor fines. The jurisdiction of comrades' courts changed slightly over time, but generally they were responsible for ""petty offences,"" i.e., something that could be resolved at the lowest level of the justice system. The rural aspect is crucial for our research. The village as a relatively closed social space was and to a large extent still is the principal site of customary law (the concept coined and intensively studied in pre-revolutionary times primarily in reference to rural social relations). The village may be seen as a peculiar legal environment featuring alternative ideas on justice (what is right and wrong, particular sensibilities in respect to certain offences such as breaches of rural moral code, gender differences in relation to various offenses, etc.), specific practices of social control (e.g., ""shaming"" of the perpetrators), and mechanisms of conflict resolution. Certainly, one can not say that rural Russia in the 1960-80s ""resurrected"" practices of informal conflict resolution that existed in the second half of the 19th century However, we assume that there existed something in the structure of rural society itself that allowed these pre-revolutionary customary law institutions to ""lay the groundwork for dispute settlement with informal procedures, drawing upon local custom and mores, and directly involving the community at large in the process.""2 The anthropology of law differentiates between two approaches to description and interpretation. The first one, the rule-centered paradigm, defines social life as ""rule-governed,"" and ""normal behavior"" as ""the product of compliance with established normative precepts."" In the second, the proces-sual paradigm, the ""dynamics of order"" is placed ""in the social process itself,"" in the ""shared networks of relations and reciprocities."" In our research we are emphasizing the second approach, which, according to well-known specialists in the area of law and culture, Austin Sarat and Thomas Kearns, states that ""law shapes society from the inside out, by providing the principal categories that make life seem natural, normal, cohesive, and coherent.""3 This approach to understanding the phenomenon of comrades' courts requires attention to the issue of law and culture because it is a particular configuration of local culture that shapes specific practices of social regulation, creating a ""dynamic synthesis of legal ideas, values, and perspectives, as well as institutions, norms, relationships and acts"" that are collectively called ""customary law.""4 As Robert Post wrote, ""We have long been accustomed to think of law as something apart. The grand ideals of justice, of impartiality and fairness, have seemed to remove law from the ordinary, disordered paths of life.""5 But as Sarat and Kearns observe: ""Thinking about Law in the Domains of Culture requires attention to networks of cultural practices. It requires us to read and interpret those practices to understand how their form and content are constituted by law and also for what they reveal about the meanings of the law itself.6 This is even more so when we speak about customary law, for it never expresses only juridical relations, but is a part of a local culture in general. The comrades' court under discussion is situated in a village where we conducted our field research over the course of almost 10 years and collected a large corpus of materials on local history, everyday life, kinship ties and relations among neighbors, rituals of calendar and life cycle, everyday conflicts, magic, internal communicative practices (gossiping, nicknaming), etc. The two main sources for our research are ""Materials and Decisions of the Comrades' Court of Shola Rural Council"" (1964-82) (henceforth, ""Materials"") and oral interviews with village inhabitants collected in 2001-06. Let us briefly describe ""sociometric factors""7 relevant for our study. Shola is a collective name for seven villages situated in close proximity to each other; the distance from the nearest town of Belozersk is about 100 km, which is a long way considering the quality of the roads. While back in the 1960s Shola's population was about 5,000 people, now it hardly exceeds 2,000. In the 1960s-80s a considerable number of people were engaged in the local collective farm, which, however, gradually ""withered away"" until it was officially closed in early 2006. At that time there were a number of public organizations in the village: apart from three comrades' courts, there was a ""women's council,"" an organization of war veterans, a village club, and a choir. The only one of these still exhibiting some signs of life is the choir. Like many other rural areas of Russia, Shola is almost exclusively an ""all-female world,"" or more precisely, an ""all-old-female world"": most of our informants are elderly widowed women between 55 and 85. Men of younger generations, roughly those around the age of 50, have moved away to district towns and large cities; those who have stayed are mostly socially inept (invalids, drunkards), and live on their mothers' pensions (Bel-06-07. MGI).8 The notion of ""women's world"" as a more internal, private space and thus less penetrable for observation9 is hardly applicable to the village studied. In Shola women occupy both private and public spaces, they work in the local stores, in the hospital, in the old people's home. The project of reviving church life was also undertaken by three elderly women.10 Back in the 1960s-80s women already constituted the majority of the village population; they occupied various public positions and, at the same time, were the center of home life. The last important social parameter to be taken into consideration in our research has to do with the specificity of rural sociability as such. It may be described as the existence of tight networks of connections, based either on kinship ties or on relations among neighbors and acquaintances, not only within Shola itself, but also between Shola and other villages of the area. This network provides for the high degree of ""informational transparency"" of the village social space: ""everybody living in villages knows everything, no matter what"" (Bel-06-04. BLP); ""a village is not a city ... even about those who live 25 kilometers away, even if there are only 20 families living there - all is known about them here"" (Bel-06-02. ZhEN); ""This [when someone was caught stealing] is shame because the whole region will know about it, for relatives live everywhere!"" (Bel-06-13. MNS).11 The notion of ""contextualized person""12 would be very much in place for this village, as compared to the city, where these ties are usually much weaker. Among other things, this total connectedness allows correlating structural and communicative factors of villagers' social communication, including that in the situation of conflict. Since our general assumption is that a discussion of rural comrades' courts should be placed within the local culture of social regulation, we will focus on the following topics: the reasons that people were reluctant to take cases to comrades' courts; pre-judicial means of conflict resolution in the village; and forms of communication within the comrades' courts. Throughout the discussion we will be paying particular attention to gender to illustrate the role of women in rural practices of conflict resolution, of which the comrades' court was a relatively new possibility.

"The role of family on increasing participation and bridging the digital divide: Evidence from an E-health study. Despite the rapid increase in the diffusion of information and communication technology (ICT) the significance of older people's connection with their families on their willingness to use the Internet remains unclear. The aim of this chapter is to examine how family members helped to bridge the digital divide by influencing older people's use of the Internet. Our sample includes older people (n=108) from a deprived area of Greater Manchester, UK who have heart problems. Thus, they have much to gain from =virtual mobility' because they may be less likely to have home Internet access or to visit public Internet facilities. On the other hand, since they are likely to have fewer pre-existing online social ties, their initial inclination may be lower. We draw on the qualitative comments from the focus groups we conducted (n=30) alongside a 9-month randomized control trial in addition to comments posted on our project portal. Our study adds to the literature by examining the advantages of home computer and Internet access for those previously without them, while most studies focus on public use or those who already own computers. Further, by focusing on a sample that encounters multiple exclusions (e.g., deprived financially, poor health, older) we can develop a better understanding of the complex nature of the digital divide. Our findings suggest that grandchildren played an important part in the uptake and continued use of their computers for several people. Although some people reported that family relations had some negative influences on their Internet use, most had a positive experience and even developed new common interests with children, grandchildren, siblings and their spouses. We draw on Bourdieu's concept of habitus to understand the role that family had in shaping Internet use. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.",1,1,1,0
"Lessons learned: Staff perceptions of the Nintendo Wii as a health promotion tool within an aged-care and disability service. Issue addressed: Enhancing opportunities for all older people to be physically and mentally active is an imperative in our ageing society. Lessons learned from the use of the Nintendo Wii within Queensland agedcare and disability services were assembled through eliciting staff perceptions regarding the usefulness of Wii technology within their centres. Methods: Telephone interviews were conducted with direct care staff in 53 centres that had been using the Wii technology for at least three months. Content analysis of interview data identified the major response patterns raised by staff. Results: Staff noted that Wii activities were easy to master for more able clients and that there was minimal risk to clients. Staff reported that these activities provided health promoting physical benefits (mobility, range of motion, dexterity, coordination, distraction from pain) and psychosocial gains (social engagement, self-esteem, mastery, ability to pacify challenging behaviours) and were a useful adjunct to other care practices within these aged-care and disabilities services. Conclusions: Staff believed that Wii activities provided purposeful and meaningful opportunities to promote wellbeing for aged and disabled clients within an aged-care and disability service. However, Wii activities were less successful with clients who had significant cognitive and/or physical disabilities.",0,0,0,1
"Using facebook within a geriatric pharmacotherapy course. Objective. To evaluate using an Internet-based social networking site within an elective geriatric pharmacotherapy course. Design. Thirty pharmacy students enrolled in a geriatric pharmacotherapy elective course were invited to join a closed Facebook (Facebook Inc, Palo Alto, CA) group to enhance communication among students and faculty members within the course. Creating a discussion board was the primary activity in the course. Each week, 3 students were assigned to post a healthy aging topic, and other students in the class were expected to post their comments and reactions. The healthy aging topics also were discussed during class. Assessment. Students wrote reflections about their experiences using Facebook for the activities within this course. A survey instrument also measured students' opinions about using Facebook for educational purposes. Conclusion. Using Facebook allowed students to discuss topics more openly and encouraged classroom discussions of healthy aging topics.",0,0,0,1
"Older adults in an aging society and social computing: A research agenda. The expansion of the social computing environment as a new basis for socioeconomic activities could enhance the quality of life of older adults, but also it could make the problem of digital divide more serious. In this study, the research directions and agenda of social computing for an aging society are presented, which have two major directions: basic study and applied study. Regarding human aspects in social computing mainly dealt with in the basic study, existing research and related theories on cognitive characteristics, information usage patterns, and social network site use of older adults were examined. In the applied study, a study about the most effective contents application and interfaces through user needs analysis, usage context analysis, prototype design, and so on, was conducted. Those studies are discussed to develop applications on a PC platform, mobile platform, and IPTV platform targeting the older adults population. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1,0,0,0
"Too many facebook ""Friends""? Content sharing and sociability versus the need for privacy in social network sites. Little research has been conducted on the two most important criteria for the success of social network sites (SNS), that is, content sharing and sociability, and how these affect privacy experiences and usage behavior among SNS users. This article explores these issues by employing in-depth interviews and explorative usability tests, comparing the experiences and usage of younger and older Facebook users. First, the interviews revealed that Facebook users in all age groups reported more contact with several different groups of people, which reflects different types of social capital (i.e., family, friends, and acquaintances), because of Facebook, but not without consequences for privacy. Having too many Facebook ""friends"" and access to different social capital disrupt the sharing process due to experiences of social surveillance and social control. This social control often forces younger people in particular to use conformity as a strategy when sharing content to maintain their privacy. Further, the interviews revealed different motivations and usage patterns when older and younger users are compared. Second, the usability test found a significant difference between younger and older adults in time completion and task completion related to Facebook settings. Younger users are more skilled in their Facebook usage, whereas adults over the age of 40 have difficulties in understanding the navigation logic and privacy settings. Younger and older adults display completely open public profiles without realizing it. Finally, the design and theoretical implications of the findings are discussed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0,0,0,0
"Situated learning and identity development in a korean older adults' computer classroom. Situated learning theory understands learning to be a sociocultural activity, and individuals experience identity development as they participate in communities of practice. The purpose of this study was to understand how Korean older adults' computer learning in a classroom is a situated activity and how this learning influences older adults' identities. Eleven sessions of an intermediate course for older adults were observed, and 10 older computer learners were interviewed. This study revealed that social interactions, learning tools, the physical setting, and Korean culture were embedded in the course and shaped the learning processes. This study also found that the participants' learning in the community of practice in the classroom as well as the larger community of general computer users influenced their identity. © 2010 American Association for Adult and Continuing Education.",1,0,0,0
"Decent digital social media for senior life: A practical design approach. This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan. The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",1,0,0,0
"Assessment of patient and caregiver needs in fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome by utilizing Q-sort methodology. Objectives: Psychosocial stressors faced by patients with fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and their caregivers have not been systematically explored. FXTAS is a neurodegenerative disease occurring in approximately 45% of elderly male carriers and 8-16% of female carriers of the fragile X mental retardation one premutation. This study investigated the subjective needs of patients with FXTAS and their family caregivers, by utilizing Q-sort methodology. Method: Patients with FXTAS and their caregivers seen during January 2005 to June 2007 participated. The Q-sort was composed of 17 (eight formal and nine informal) items, designed to explore emotional, informational, and instrumental needs of patients with FXTAS and their caregivers. Item scores were generated from 1 = least important to 7 = most important. Analysis included descriptive statistics for all the demographic and outcome variables. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify which of the need domains were perceived as most important by the participants. Results: A total of 24 patients (79% men, mean age 65.6±6.4 years) with FXTAS and 18 caregivers (11% men, mean age 63.6±6.2 years) completed the Q-sort. Both patients and caregivers rated informational needs as most important, followed by emotional and, finally, by instrumental needs. Participants lacked many important resources, in particular those addressing instrumental needs. Conclusion: Providers should be educated and able to provide timely information and referrals to formal services, as well as to informal resources, including the National Fragile X Foundation online support network (www.fragilex.org). © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",1,0,0,1
"Preprocessing techniques for context recognition from accelerometer data. The ubiquity of communication devices such as smartphones has led to the emergence of context-aware services that are able to respond to specific user activities or contexts. These services allow communication providers to develop new, added-value services for a wide range of applications such as social networking, elderly care and near-emergency early warning systems. At the core of these services is the ability to detect specific physical settings or the context a user is in, using either internal or external sensors. For example, using built-in accelerometers, it is possible to determine whether a user is walking or running at a specific time of day. By correlating this knowledge with GPS data, it is possible to provide specific information services to users with similar daily routines. This article presents a survey of the techniques for extracting this activity information from raw accelerometer data. The techniques that can be implemented in mobile devices range from classical signal processing techniques such as FFT to contemporary string-based methods. We present experimental results to compare and evaluate the accuracy of the various techniques using real data sets collected from daily activities. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.",0,0,0,0

"I feel less lonely: What older people say about participating in a social networking website. This paper presents the findings from a qualitative pilot project that implemented an internet social networking intervention and evaluated the effect it had on older people's experience of temporal loneliness. The project was implemented over a three-month period and utilised an in-home, one-on- one education strategy. Six older people aged 69 to 85 years were recruited from a community aged care programme in South Australia. All participants were connected to the internet and provided with one-on-one tutoring in how to use the social networking site. To evaluate the project, data were collected through in-depth interviews with older people at the commencement and completion of the project. An additional interview with the community programme co-ordinator was conducted at the completion of the project. Evaluation was also guided by data collected by the research team via reflective journals. The key findings to emerge from the inductive analysis of the data resulted in four major themes, these were: the participants' experience of loneliness; technology as an enabler; providing a supportive environment; connectivity. A case study is presented to provide in-depth understanding of how social networking can help reduce the participants' experience of loneliness. The findings from this project demonstrated that the utilisation of a social networking site has the potential to reduce loneliness in older people and therefore, based on these findings, recommendations for further research and practice implementation are made. In particular the project team recommends expanding the current pilot project into a larger scale project. © Pier Professional Ltd.",1,1,1,0
"Elven Elder LVL59 LFP/RB. Please PM me': Immersion,collaborative tasks and problem-solving in massively multiplayer online games. Although there is strong evidence that massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) constitute environments of social interactions and effective learning, we currently lack the tools for investigating the effectiveness of the social networks emerging as well as the cognitive aspects and knowledge acquisition such environments involve. Within this context, we present a conceptual framework for the investigation of the collaborative problem-solving processes emerging in such environments and we apply it in the investigation of a number of MMOGs through interviews and virtual ethnography. Our findings suggest the balanced convergence of multiple factors, such as the mechanics of the game, the design of the tasks, the collaboration and competition affordances and the content of the game, for the constitution of an effective environment for collaborative learning. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",0,0,0,0
"Work to retirement: A snapshot of psychological health in a multicultural Australian population. Objective: The specific aim of this study was to explore psychological well-being in workers and retirees and compare responses from people who came from an overseas-born population and those from an Australian born. Participants: Participants were self-selected, voluntary, informed research participants aged 50 years and older. One hundred and ninety-five people born in Australia and retiring in Australia and 91 people born overseas retiring in Australia responded to an internet-based survey that comprised the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, the PTSD Checklist, the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Duke Social Support Index. Method: Two-way analysis of variance was conducted for dependent variables against: (1) being born in Australia Yes/No, and (2) Retired/Employed. Results: In terms of adjustment to retirement the findings indicate no significant differences in psychological symptoms during the retirement transition phase between populations. Conclusion: Further research needs to be carried out to consider the role of possible explanatory factors that may contribute to the psychological transition to retirement. © 2010 IOS Press and the authors.",0,0,0,1
"Seniors' online communities: A quantitative content analysis. Purpose: To examine the contents and characteristics of seniors' online communities and to explore their potential benefits to older adults.Design and Methods: Quantitative content analysis of a full year's data from 14 leading online communities using a novel computerized system. The overall database included 686,283 messages.Results: There was a constant increase in the daily activity level during the research period. Content analysis identified 13 main subjects discussed in the communities, including (in descending order) ""Fun on line,"" ""Retirement,"" ""Family,"" ""Health,"" ""Work and Study,"" ""Recreation"" ""Finance,"" ""Religion and Spirituality,"" ""Technology,"" ""Aging,"" ""Civic and Social,"" ""Shopping,"" and ""Travels."" The overall tone was somewhat more positive than negative.Implications: The findings suggest that the utilities of Information and Communications Technologies for older adults that were identified in previous research are valid for seniors' online communities as well. However, the findings suggest several other possible benefits, which may be available only to online communities. The communities may provide social support, contribute to self-preservation, and serve as an opportunity for self-discovery and growth. Because they offer both leisure activity and an expanded social network, it is suggested that active participation in the communities may contribute to the well-being of older adults. Directions for future research and applied implications are further discussed. © The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.

"The psychosocial oncology learning assessment: A province-wide survey of cancer care providers' learning needs. A psychosocial oncology learning needs assessment was developed and offered online to cancer care providers in a variety of settings across all health regions in British Columbia. The purpose was to better understand the psychosocial learning needs of cancer care providers and to use this knowledge to shape continuing education priorities. Respondents' preferred learning formats, access to technology and barriers to accessing psychosocial learning opportunities were also assessed. Cancer care providers including radiation therapists, social workers, dieticians, pharmacists, physicians and nurses in both community and agency settings were surveyed. Two hundred and sixtyseven people completed the survey. Key learning needs identified included cultural aspects of care, symptom management, treating the anxious patient, self-care for the professional, care of elderly patients, basic cancer-related medical issues surrounding care and ethics. Community respondents indicated more needs than agency respondents. On-site training was the most preferred learning format, and time constraints were the biggest barrier to accessing learning opportunities. Participants had access to technology. Next steps include conducting key informant and focus group interviews to determine if interest in a learning need is the same as a relevant knowledge and practice gap. This research suggests that cancer care providers are interested in learning more about the psychosocial issues related to cancer care. © Springer 2010.",0,0,0,0
"Exploring the efficacy and moderators of two computer-tailored physical activity interventions for older adults: A randomized controlled trial. Background Important health benefits can be derived when low-cost (e.g., computer-tailored) physical activity interventions for older adults demonstrate sustained effects. Purpose The purpose of the study was to conduct in-depth analysis on the long-term efficacy of two tailored physical activity interventions for older adults. Methods A randomized controlled trial (n=1,971) with two computer-tailored interventions and a no-intervention control group was conducted. The two tailored interventions consisted of three tailored letters, delivered during 4 months. The basic tailored intervention targeted psychosocial determinants alone, while the environmentally tailored intervention additionally targeted environmental determinants, by providing tailored environmental information. Selfreported behaviors (i.e., total physical activity, transport walking and cycling, leisure walking and cycling, and sports) were measured at baseline and 12 months. Additionally, potential personal, health-related, and psychosocial moderators of the intervention effects were examined. Results The environmentally tailored intervention was effective in changing total physical activity, leisure cycling, and sports compared with the basic intervention and control group. No intervention effects were found for the basic intervention. Moderation analysis revealed that participants with a higher age, lower body mass index, and higher intention were unresponsive to the interventions. Conclusions Providing environmental information is an effective intervention strategy for increasing physical activity behaviors among older adults, especially among certain ""at-risk"" subgroups such as lower educated, overweight, or insufficiently active participants. Moderation analysis was perceived as a promising method for identifying meaningful subgroups that are unaffected by an intervention, which should receive special attention in future interventions. © The Society of Behavioral Medicine 2010.",1,1,1,1
"Aurama: Caregiver awareness for living independently with an augmented picture frame display. Aurama is a system designed to provide peace of mind and a sense of connectedness to adults who care for elderly parents living alone. Aurama monitors the elders at home using unobtrusive sensor technology and collects data about sleeping patterns, weight trends, cognitive abilities and presence at home. The system provides an unobtrusive ambient information display that presents the status of the elder and lets its users inspect long-term data about the well-being of the elder interactively. Aurama was designed iteratively with substantial user involvement through interviews, prototype evaluation, focus groups and lab tests. The final prototype was evaluated in two field trials each involving an elder and their adult children. The input of users throughout the design process and during these tests demonstrates clearly the potential of awareness systems to support the target user group to obtain peace of mind and feel connected. Furthermore, the users indicate a clear need for information on long-term trends relating to the well-being of aging parents, in contrast to the current emphasis in this field of research on providing instantaneous status information about daily activities and context. © 2010 The Author(s).",1,0,0,0
"Interaction of stress, lead burden, and age on cognition in older men: The VA normative aging study. Background: Low-level exposure to lead and to chronic stress may independently influence cognition. However, the modifying potential of psychosocial stress on the neurotoxicity of lead and their combined relationship to aging-associated decline have not been fully examined. Objectives: We examined the cross-sectional interaction between stress and lead exposure on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores among 811 participants in the Normative Aging Study, a cohort of older U.S. men. Methods: We used two self-reported measures of stress appraisal-a self-report of stress related to their most severe problem and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Indices of lead exposure were blood lead and bone (tibia and patella) lead. Results: Participants with higher self-reported stress had lower MMSE scores, which were adjusted for age, education, computer experience, English as a first language, smoking, and alcohol intake. In multivariable-adjusted tests for interaction, those with higher PSS scores had a 0.57-point lower (95% confidence interval, -0.90 to 0.24) MMSE score for a 2-fold increase in blood lead than did those with lower PSS scores. In addition, the combination of high PSS scores and high blood lead categories on one or both was associated with a 0.05-0.08 reduction on the MMSE for each year of age compared with those with low PSS score and blood lead level (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Psychological stress had an independent inverse association with cognition and also modified the relationship between lead exposure and cognitive performance among older men. Furthermore, high stress and lead together modified the association between age and cognition.",1,0,0,1
"Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study. Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",1,0,0,1
"Prevalence and correlates of emotional, physical, sexual, and financial abuse and potential neglect in the United States: The national elder mistreatment study. Objectives. We estimated prevalence and assessed correlates of emotional, physical, sexual, and financial mistreatment and potential neglect (defined as an identified need for assistance that no one was actively addressing) of adults aged 60 years or older in a randomly selected national sample. Methods. We compiled a representative sample by random digit dialing across geographic strata. We used computer-assisted telephone interviewing to standardize collection of demographic, risk factor, and mistreatment data. We subjected prevalence estimates and mistreatment correlates to logistic regression. Results. We analyzed data from 5777 respondents. One-year prevalence was 4.6% for emotional abuse, 1.6% for physical abuse, 0.6% for sexual abuse, 5.1% for potential neglect, and 5.2% for current financial abuse by a family member. One in 10 respondents reported emotional, physical, or sexual mistreatment or potential neglect in the past year. The most consistent correlates of mistreatment across abuse types were low social support and previous traumatic event exposure. Conclusions. Our data showed that abuse of the elderly is prevalent. Addressing low social support with preventive interventions could have significant public health implications.",1,0,0,1
"Out and Aging: The MetLife study of lesbian and gay baby boomers. The baby boom generation has lived through a period of tremendous cultural change, including significant shifts in social attitudes toward, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (GLBT) issues. As they plan for retirement and for their eventual long-term care and end-of-life needs, GLBT baby boomers share in the hopes and experiences that characterize the largest generation in American history. At the same time, however, they reflect certain unique family structures and gender role differences-and they confront distinct concerns about caregiving, social support networks, retirement and end-of-life planning. In February 2006, in partnership with the MetLife Mature Market Institute, the Lesbian and Gay Aging Issues Network of the American Society on Aging undertook the first U.S. national survey of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender baby boomers. A sample of 1,000 self-identified GLBT people ages 40 to 61 participated in an online survey conducted by Zogby International, a leading polling and public-opinion research firm.3 The snapshot of GLBT baby boomers that emerges from the survey raises important questions for the wide range of professionals who work with older adults, employers, policymakers, and everyone interested in ensuring dignity, independence and the highest possible quality of life for the boomer generation as it reaches midlife and old age. Caregiving and Social Support Networks One in four respondents said that they had provided care for an adult friend or family member within the last six months. This high incidence of caregiving is particularly surprising, as previous studies of the U.S. population as a whole have found only one in five adults is a caregiver.4 Strikingly, about the same proportions of gay and bisexual men and lesbian and bisexual women are serving as caregivers. In contrast, recent studies of the general population have found that only between 25% and 44% of caregivers are male.5 The relatively even percentages of male and female GLBT caregivers in this study suggest that gay and bisexual men may be providing care much more frequently than men in the overall U.S. population. More than one-third (36%) of GLBT boomers who are caregivers are caring for parents, while about half as many (18%) are caring for their partners. An additional 14% are caring for friends and another 12% are caring for other nonrelatives. Even though at least three-quarters of the respondents expect to become caregivers for someone else, almost one in five reported being unsure who will take care of them when the need arises. This was especially the case for those without partners or spouses, of whom more than one-third said they are not sure who would provide them with needed care. In addition to close ties with their families of origin, more than three-quarters of the respondents have important connections with what researchers have called families of choice-close friends who are ""like family"" or ""like a second or extended family."" Concerns about Aging and Retirement Both lesbian and bisexual women as well as gay and bisexual men share a concern about their financial stability as they age into retirement. For women, their greatest fear is outliving their income as they age. For men, their great fear is becoming dependent upon others and becoming sick or disabled. More than a quarter (27%) of GLBT boomers reported great concern about discrimination as they age, and less than half expressed strong confidence that healthcare professionals will treat them ""with dignity and respect."" Fears of insensitive and discriminatory treatment by healthcare professionals are particularly strong among lesbians, of whom 12% said they have absolutely no confidence that they will be treated respectfully. GLBT baby boomers clearly want to spend their final days in the comfort of their own homes. Nearly half (47%) said they would like their end-of-life care to take place in their current residence with the help of hospice care, followed at a distant second by 16 percent who would prefer to spend their final days in their current homes without hospice care. Lesbian and bisexual women appear to be less financially prepared for the end of life. For instance, they are notably less likely than their male counterparts to have purchased long-term care insurance or to have written wills. One half (51%) of GLBT baby boomers have yet to complete wills or living wills spelling out their long-term care and end-of-life wishes-yet such documents are particularly important for GLBT older adults given the current lack of legal protection for GLBT couples and families. Almost 40 percent of respondents believe that being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender has helped them prepare for aging in some way. They have developed positive character traits, greater resilience, or better support networks as a consequence of being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. © 2006 MetLife, Inc.",0,0,0,0
"Information technologies and transitions in the lives of 55-65-year-olds: The case of colliding life interests. More and more people entering the stage of retirement at around age 55-65 are healthy, active, and also very computer-literate. This trend is rapidly changing the common image of late-midlife technology users, which rests on the assumption that they find it difficult to embrace new technologies and also that their main interests are health related. Although technology use and lifestyles are changing, however, many other aspects of life remain the same. One of these aspects is that of the transitions, or life changes, that generally take place in these years. Besides retirement, these transitions include changes in health, housing, social interaction, work life, and personal finance. People develop different ways of coping with these transitions, which brings up interesting issues related to the late midlife stage. This paper presents a diary-aided interview study of late middle-age adults (N = 24) in Finland and Sweden with a focus on the interplay between technologies and transitions. Transitions were found to play a part in how the life interests of late middle-aged persons are often conflictive, forcing them to choose from among various 'possible selves'. At its best, technology can help alleviate these tensions. This finding is exemplified in the paper's discussion of two design implications associated with particular clashes of interests, related to how daily activities are organized and how contact is maintained with one's friends and family. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform. Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment. Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",0,0,0,1
"Social support, health service use and mental health among caregivers of the elderly in rural China. This cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the status of social support, health service use and mental health among caregivers for the elderly in a Chinese rural community. With randomized stratified sampling method, 199 caregivers providing long-term care for the elderly recruited from a Chinese rural community responded to the survey and were administered the questionnaire, measuring the caregiving outcome for the elderly. The social support was assessed with the social support scale (SSS) and social network scale (SNS). Health service utilization was assessed with the questionnaire on health service use (HSU). Depression was evaluated with the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Most caregivers are elder's spouse (39.7%), son (26.1%) and daughter-in-law (18.1%). Three common health service used by the caregivers are visiting physician (68.0%), help from relatives or friends (43.9%) and seeking help of herbal doctors or traditional healers (34.0%). Between caregivers for healthy and non-healthy elders, there was significant difference of depression scale score (t = 3.195, p < 0.01), not of SSS and SNS scale scores (p > 0.05). The score of depression scale are associated with caregivers' age (β = 0.260) and income (β = -0.231), care-recipients' gender (β = 0.187) and age (β = 0.800), caring time (β = 0.138) and the total SNS score (β = -0.194) (all p < 0.05). The findings suggest, in Chinese rural area, family provides main source for caregiving to the elderly, with spouse and sons playing central roles. Most often elderly caregivers utilize medical resources. Depression during the process of caregiving is associated with caregivers and care-recipients' background characteristics, with potential mediator effect of social support.

Background: The aim of this study was to explore the working mechanisms of a computer tailored physical activity intervention for older adults with environmental information compared to a basic tailored intervention without environmental information. Method: A clustered randomized controlled trial with two computer tailored interventions and a no-intervention control group was conducted among 1971 adults aged ≥ 50. The two tailored interventions were developed using Intervention Mapping and consisted of three tailored letters delivered over a four-month period. The basic tailored intervention targeted psychosocial determinants alone, while the environmentally tailored intervention additionally targeted environmental determinants, by providing tailored environmental information. Study outcomes were collected with questionnaires at baseline, three and six months and comprised total physical activity (days/week), walking (min/week), cycling (min/week), sports (min/week), environmental perceptions and use and appreciation of the interventions. Results: Mediation analyses showed that changes in cycling, sports and total physical activity behaviour induced by the environmentally tailored intervention were mediated by changes in environmental perceptions. Changes in environmental perceptions did not mediate the effect of the basic tailored intervention on behaviour. Compared with the basic tailored intervention, the environmentally tailored intervention significantly improved cycling behaviour (τ = 30.2). Additionally, the tailored letters of the environmentally tailored intervention were better appreciated and used, although these differences did not mediate the intervention effect. Discussion: This study gave some first indications of the relevance of environmental perceptions as a determinant of changing physical activity behaviours and the potential effectiveness of providing environmental information as an intervention strategy aimed at enhancing physical activity behaviour among older adults. © 2009 van Stralen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",0,1,0,1
"""A little silly and empty-headed"" - Older adults' understandings of social networking sites. This study suggests reasons for the absence of a growing proportion of the population, the so-called baby boomers, from the otherwise highly popular social networking sites. We explore how people of this age group understand social networking sites and how these understandings fit certain aspects of their life. Designing social networking sites that match older adults' life would increase their possibilities of coping with the changes related to their age and of contributing to the information society. In a qualitative study involving use of an existing social networking site, and group and personal interviews, we found that understanding the internet as a dangerous place, and social networking sites as places of socially unacceptable behavior, hinders the use of these technologies. To include older adults, we propose arrangement of social events for getting familiarized with these services and offering of clear and simple privacy management on the sites. These actions have implications for users of all ages. © 2009 The Author.",1,0,0,0
"Using ecological momentary assessment to examine antecedents and correlates of physical activity bouts in adults age 50+ Years: A pilot study. Background: National recommendations supporting the promotion of multiple short (10+ minute) physical activity bouts each day to increase overall physical activity levels in middle-aged and older adults underscore the need to identify antecedents and correlates of such daily physical activity episodes. Purpose: This pilot study used Ecological Momentary Assessment to examine the time-lagged and concurrent effects of empirically supported social, cognitive, affective, and physiological factors on physical activity among adults age 50+ years. Methods: Participants (N = 23) responded to diary prompts on a handheld computer four times per day across a 2-week period. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), self-efficacy, positive and negative affect, control, demand, fatigue, energy, social interactions, and stressful events were assessed during each sequence. Results: Multivariate results showed that greater self-efficacy and control predicted greater MVPA at each subsequent assessment throughout the day (p < 0.05). Also, having a positive social interaction was concurrently related to higher levels of MVPA (p = 0.052). Conclusion: Time-varying multidimensional individual processes predict within daily physical activity levels. © 2009 The Society of Behavioral Medicine.",0,0,0,1
"An assessment of female participation in income generating activities in agriculture sector in rural areas of district sialkot. Pakistan is an agricultural country and agriculture is the mainstay of the economy. Rural women play a vital role in various arenas of life. An ordinary farm woman is the main player to sustain life activities both at home and farm. They have active role in agriculture farming. In addition to their involvement in community development activities and maintaining social relations, they also work in domestic chores by taking care of cooking, cleaning of housing, washing of clothes caring of children/elderly and fetching of water and fuel. Women often spend more time to these tasks than men do. The main objective of the present study is to assess the participation of rural women in income generating activities in agricultural sector. A sample of 200 was selected by using convenient sampling technique in the rural areas of Tehsil Daska, District Sialkot. Two villages were selected randomly from one Union Council. The data were analyzed through convenient sampling technique. Main findings show that majority of the respondents were engaged in vegetable picking, animal caring etc. activities. Results show that majority of the respondents were earning Rs. 1501-2000 per month. A huge majority of the respondents worked outside the home and were satisfied with the working condition over there. It is suggested that rural women should be provided time and energy-saving technology and technical know-how to help ease their workload, especially, in livestock production, gardening, post-harvest activities and food processing.",0,0,0,0
"Contradictions across space-time and language ideologies in northern arapaho language shift. In 1878, when the federal government relocated the Northern Arapaho tribe to the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, all of the approximately eight hundred members were fluent in their indigenous language. Most were also fluent in Plains Indian sign language, some in one or more neighboring languages, and only several in English. By 2005 less than approximately 7 percent of the more than six thousand members of the tribe remained fluent in Arapaho. As Salzmann (1998:287) confirms, language shift has progressed to what can be defined as an irreversible stage. At present all remaining fluent speakers are bilingual and members of at least the grandparental generation. The age discrepancy in fluency varies with family and individual childrearing contexts, but only several people under the age of seventy remain fluent. Today, all children acquire English as their first language. In all social domains English predominates except in educational contexts for language renewal, ceremonial speech, and occasional interaction among elders. When elders are together they sporadically switch to Arapaho but generally only for a few exchanges as a speech event unfolds. Despite concerted efforts over the past twentyfive years, language renewal programs have produced no fluent speakers among younger generation students studying it as a second language in formal educational contexts. In the Northern Arapaho speech community the process of language shift over the past seventy years, and more recent efforts in the past three decades to reverse it, have been concomitant with a proliferation of competing and converging language ideologies. During the same history the Wind River Reservation social landscape and temporal order have changed dramatically. During my first continuous field study of 1988-94 I participated in many language and cultural education programs and was thus daily immersed in discourse articulating these ideologies. As Arapaho people talked about elements or the whole of language(s), I came to realize that the ideologies expressed were efforts to understand and resolve contradictions generated by the dramatically changing environment beyond language itself. Older fluent speakers today comment, often with a profound sense of loss, that they have few opportunities in their daily lives to speak Arapaho with others. With modern ordering of space-time, the vast majority of elders live in nuclear or extended domestic social spaces in which they are the single speaker or only one among several fluent senior relatives. Those who participate in interviews and educational programs often mentioned to me that they looked forward to such rare times to speak the language and connect with others in their own generation. As many observe, language shift is not just a demographic process of declining numbers of speakers but also a process of contracting ""domains"" of usage (Fishman 1972:440-53) or sites of cultural production (Silverstein 1998b:138). Language or speech does not, however, construct the social space and time of its use sui generis. As I explain elsewhere (Anderson 1998:51-52), domains themselves are equally constituted by the interdimensionality of time and space on a number of levels. The socially constructed spaces and time orientations in which Arapaho people live, such as ceremony, home, school, political discourse, and economic activity, have all changed significantly in history, both in the ways sites reproduce social relations internally and in the speech practices that link the domains together. Borrowing a useful term from Giddens, it is insightful to examine speech practices and reflective ideologies relative to ""time-space zones"" as individuals and groups move through ""time-space paths"" (1987:146) in daily life and trajectories of larger extension, such as the annual calendar, life cycle, and family history. What is needed is more attention in anthropology to the way communities change their speech practices in response to constructed changes in the physical and social environment. Built environments can enhance or inhibit any social practices, whether by design or unintentionally (Lawrence and Low 1990:461). More generally, as Harvey recognizes, imposed orders of space and time are the principal apparatus of ""conquest, imperial expansion, and neocolonial domination"" (1990:419). Following Foucault (1984:252), it can be said that governments exert power through built forms in a process of canalization, the control of the flow and distribution of individual bodies in space. With respect to time, Munn states, ""Control over time is not just a strategy of interaction; it is a medium of hierarchic power and governance"" (1992:109). Top-down-imposed orders of space and time were alien to indigenous peoples and as a whole were the primary apparatus for transforming the system of social reproduction, including language and culture. It is therefore essential to examine ways Arapaho people have tried to appropriate those structures, construct new structures, or adapt traditional ones to invent or sustain language and culture. In Native American history, dominant ideologies and their instantiation in local space-time orientation have never been coherently hegemonic. Approaches to language ideologies must steer theory away from reified social forces or hegemony toward an understanding of competing and historically shifting ideologies, which Friedrich defines as ""pragmatic ideologies"" (1989:300-302), grounded in the particular, concrete practices in local, socially constructed spaces and time orientations. Rather than blending, though, Euro-American oppressive and progressive ideologies have generated enduring contradictions in a hybridized chaos unique to the space-time of reservation communities in the United States. Wind River, like other reservations, is largely a constructed environment (Lawrence and Low 1990) always in the making and remaking, shaped by state policies that shift precipitously among competing, evolving ideologies that never congeal into a coherent or uniform system of thought qualifying as hegemony any group can embrace or resist in total. Thus, Arapaho language has shifted to English in a history in which, as Althusser recognized, ""the locus of confrontation may vary according to the relation of the contradictions in the structure in dominance in any given situation"" (1969:215-16). Dominant language ideologies are therefore neither wholly uniform nor explicitly durable within a speech community undergoing shift. At one level, language shift on reservations took place in a social space-time different from that of other groups, such as urban or transnational immigrant ethnic groups. State-sponsored shifting utopian models in reservation history have resulted in a local heterotopian space-time (Foucault 1986). The contradiction between utopian missions of integration and heterotopian realities of sequestration provides the material for many local language ideologies. As discussed below in more detail, Arapaho language ideologies negotiate but never resolve the contradictions between a utopian language renewal mission and the objective reality of shift as an irreversible process, between the utopian model of Euro-American education as the universalizable solution to all problems and the impoverished local political economy, and between idealized nostalgic purism within Arapaho ideologies and the proliferation of modern technologies and bureaucratic apparatuses of communication and governance. In the relatively new study of language shift there has been a tendency to remain unreflexive about the social scientific ideological ground and spatiotemporal constructions that support it (Collins 1998:259). To borrow Phillipson's terms, models of shift are often ""bedeviled by myths and binary over-simplifications"" (1992:23). Today there is no permanent, closed, ""us versus them"" border to contest, no singular Euro-American ideology set against a singular Arapaho language ideology, and there probably never has been. Beginning in the 1880s, for example, competing Euro-American ideologies approached the Arapaho speech community with contradictory purposes, such that repression reigned in some time-space zones, while acceptance and even valorization applied in others. In the mission boarding school at St. Stephens children were barred from speaking Arapaho in the classroom, but in chapel the priests and brothers spoke Arapaho with the aim of conversion. By the 1890s and early 1900s other Euro-Americans arrived to research the very language and culture that federal agents sought to eradicate. Dimensions of space and time interrelate to define language ideologies in four correlative ways, which I explore in the rest of this chapter. First, competing dominant culture ideologies have imposed orders of space and time on the reservation as solutions to the ""Indian problem,"" reflecting a range of dominant ideologies toward American Indians, from extreme racism to progressive compassion. Beginning with the first relation, as Deloria suggests, ""It is debatable which factor was most important in the destruction of tribal ceremonial life: The prohibition of performances of traditional rituals by the government, or the introduction of white man's system of keeping time"" (1985:18). The same statement applies if language prohibition is inserted and the effects of time for restructuring space appended. It is not enough to situate language loss and ideological frames about it in the narrow spaces, policies, or historical moments wherein Arapaho language has been openly repressed. © 2009 by University of Arizona Press.

"Guided participation in ICT-education for seniors: Motivation and social support. The Seniors' Club (SC) is a computer club for elderly, aged 60-80 years. This paper describes the experience gained from starting, and development of the club in Eastern Finland from late 2005. The findings are supported by thematic interviews conducted with the participants in April 2009. The goal of the undertaking was to teach useful ICT-skills to the elderly, and to empower them to contribute to user-centered design. A guidance model based on guided participation and ideas of shared cognition has been applied to socially, motivationally and cognitively support our elderly participants. For the development of SC-concept, the grounding research methodology has been action research, supported by observation of the participants at work, questionnaires and group interviews. The results show that the elderly are capable of and enthusiastic in acquiring ICT-skills and of gaining knowledge. They are motivated by the younger generation in their circle of acquaintances, by the novelty of things and by staying the pace of development. They prefer things/skills, which are practical and applicable in real life, and they appreciate the social mode of learning, like peertutoring. In addition our seniors are willing to contribute to research, design, and development activities with students in our department. ©2009 IEEE.",1,0,0,0
"Social relationships and depression among people 65 years and over living in rural and urban areas of Quebec. Objective: To compare the prevalence of depression within the elderly Quebec population residing in rural areas, urban areas and metropolitan Montreal, and to assess differences in the associations between social relationships and depression across these urban and rural settings. Methods: Data originate from the first wave of the ESA (Étude de Santé des Ainés) longitudinal study on mental health of community dwelling older persons aged over 65 (n=2670). Depression, including major and minor depression, measured using a computer questionnaire; the ESA- Q developed by the research team and based on the DSM-IV criteria. Assessments of associations between depression and geographic area, informal social networks and community participation were estimated adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic and health characteristics. Results: The prevalence of depression was higher in rural (17%) and urban areas (15.1%) than in metropolitan Montreal (10.3%). The odds ratio of rural (OR=2.01 95% CI 1.59-2.68) and urban (OR=1.75; 95% CI 1.25-2.45) areas compared to the metropolitan area increased slightly after adjustment by all social and health covariates. Our study indicated that social support and the lack of conflict in intimate relationships were associated with lower prevalence of depression in all areas. Conclusion: Geographic differences in depression exist within the elderly population in Quebec that may generate significant impact on their health and functional abilities. Further research should be conducted to explain these differences. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",1,0,0,1
"AAL in the wild - Lessons learned. In the EU-funded ALADIN project the prototype of an ambient assistive lighting system was subjected to a three-month test in private households of older people. Despite intensive usability testing in the development phase, field trials pose special challenges including ethical issues such as obtaining informed consent and the need for guidelines for interviewing old people. Besides, real-life settings give rise to particular distortion effects which have to be taken into account in the analysis of the results. Although the findings indicate any overall slight increase in peoplés mental and physical fitness, they also suggest how the prototype can be improved in several respects. Above all it has been shown that packaging the technology with social support measures is essential to achieve higher user acceptance. Besides, the article discusses lessons learned related to the organization of user testing in real-life settings. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",1,1,1,0

"It's all in how you view it: Pessimism, social relations, and life satisfaction in older adults with osteoarthritis. Objectives: Current treatments for osteoarthritis (OA) continue to leave those burdened by the condition with pain and disability which affects physical and psychological well-being. The present study examines other psychosocial factors, such as dispositional personality and social relationships, in order to investigate their influence on the well-being of 160 older adults with OA (80% women). Method: Older adults were recruited for self-reported knee or hip OA. Participants completed self-report measures of optimism and pessimism, social support, social strain, and life satisfaction using the computer program MediaLab. Measures were taken twice 9-12 months apart. Results: Results showed that, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, pessimism was related to lower social support and higher social strain. In addition, pessimism was mediated by social support in its relationship to life satisfaction. Discussion: Our models support the combined roles of pessimism and social support influencing life satisfaction over time. Future interventions may want to concentrate on improving the social relationships of people with OA to enhance psychological well-being. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",1,0,0,1
"Consumer-directed goal planning in the delivery of assistive technology services for people who are ageing with intellectual disabilities. Background A consumer-directed service-delivery approach to assistive technology and environmental modification intervention was examined with people who were ageing with intellectual disabilities. Material and Methods The intervention was based on a collaborative approach involving consumers, their social supports and service deliverers. Thirty individuals were randomly selected to receive the intervention from a sample of 75 community-dwelling adults. Outcomes related to consumers' and significant others' perceptions of performance and satisfaction with goal attainment were assessed and the consumer-directed goal planning process examined. Results Participants in the intervention group reported significantly higher levels of performance and satisfaction related to goals identified at baseline than participants in the control group. Two broad categories of goals were addressed during the intervention - basic self-care goals and participation/environmental/systems level goals. A 98% direct agreement rate between consumer-identified goals and goals addressed by service deliverers was found during the intervention. Of the environmental strategies employed during the intervention, assistive devices and systems level advocacy and action were the two most frequently used across goals. Conclusion Results provide evidence in favour of a consumer-directed approach to assistive technology and environmental modification service delivery for consumers who are ageing with intellectual disabilities. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",1,1,1,1
"Growing old in a new estate: Establishing new social networks in retirement. The benefits of a strong proximal social network for people as they advance in age are well documented, but the continuation or development of social networks may be challenged when people relocate to a new home on retirement. This paper explores the personal network development of older residents who have moved to a new suburban (but not age-specific) residential development in a general urban setting. Drawing on a case study of a new outer-suburban 'master planned estate' in Brisbane, Queensland, the findings from interviews with 51 older residents and participant observations of a community group are presented. The study suggests that a traditional ideal of unreflexive community of place was an unreliable source of durable social bonds in contemporary fragmented and mobile social conditions, where the proximity of family members, durability of tenure and strong neighbourly ties are not inevitable. One successful resolution was found in a group of older residents who through exercising agency had joined a group the sole focus of which was social companionship. The theoretical bases of this type of group are discussed and its relevance is examined for retirees who have chosen to live in a residential environment for lifestyle and amenity reasons, away from their lifelong social networks. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.",1,0,0,0
"Exploring relationships between normative aging, technology, and communication. Semistructured interviews with an educated sample explored normative aging processes and computer ownership regarding change in communication patterns over a decade among older adults as they progressed through events of the life course. Findings indicated that many of the changes concerned normative aging processes: living arrangements, physical limitations, retirement, and aging of communication partners. Changes in communication mediums aided by technology and how technology affected medium of preference for use, frequency, and quantity of communication also were found. Participant responses indicated computer ownership and Internet access increased the total social network, frequency of communication, quality of relationships, and helped reinstate distant/past friendships. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1,0,0,0
"Older adults' perceptions and experiences of online social support. This paper reports an investigation of older adults' needs and preferences concerning online social support. We focused our analysis on seven different aspects of online support: Self disclosure, Deep support, Light support, Community building, Information/Facts, Off topic, and Technical issues. For each aspect we were interested in how older adults perceive this aspect of support, what they think are the similarities and differences of this aspect of support in online settings vs offline settings, and what they perceive are the advantages and disadvantages of communicating this aspect of support online. We did this by conducting detailed interviews with three groups of older adults (31 people in total) with different levels of expertise in using the internet and online communication (older adults who do not use the internet, older adults who use only email, and older adults who participate in online support communities). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed. Our findings describe older adults' perception of different aspects of support and identify their motivation for turning to online support and the reasons for any reluctance to do so. Thus, our findings give insight into how online support communities could best be utilized to improve older people's experience with online support. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1,0,0,0
"Application of personal networks model to the study of disabled elderly [Aplicación del modolo de redes personales al estudio de los ancianos dependientes]. Introduction: Decrease of the capacity of informal support to elderly and family network and scarce increase of formal support network require other methods and strategies to study this issue. The analysis of social network can be useful to analyze available social resources for disabled elderly. Material and methods: Descriptive research dated was made between November 29 and July 1 2008. The information was obtained from interviews supported by computer to 40 disabled elder. Results: 80% of disabled elderly (Egos) was more than 75 years, 42.5% lived alone; almost half of Alters (individuals of the environment of the elderly) were retired and belonged to same generation than elderly. Density and cohesion of social network, mediated for stock of capital social, influenced positively on subjective perception of health and had an effect in Capital Social stock too to favor good auto-perception of health indirectly.

"Home-based communication system for older adults and their remote family. As in many Latin-American countries, in Mexico many older adults live alone as a result of the migration of one or more of their relatives, mostly to the USA. Thus, not only do they live alone, but they might seldom see these relatives for long periods, even though they often depend on them financially. With the goal of designing appropriate communication technology for seniors and their relatives experiencing this situation, we conducted interviews and evaluated scenarios and prototypes to reveal the practical ways they maintain emotional ties despite the distance. Based on those findings, we envisioned a communication system through which seniors and their relatives can maintain close social ties by sharing information, personal reminiscences and stories. We found that older adults perceived the system as a richer, natural form of communication with their relatives that could facilitate their integration into the networks that currently connect members of their families. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Adherence to antiretroviral medication in older adults living with HIV/AIDS: A comparison of alternative models. The CDC estimates that by 2015, half of all persons living with HIV/AIDS in the USA will be over the age of 50. Despite increasing HIV seroprevalence rates in older adults, most research examining adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has focused on young HIV-infected persons and, in general, has been atheoretical in nature. This study examined two ART adherence conceptual frameworks to determine whether these models generalize to HIV-seropositive older adults. Two hundred and forty-four HIV-positive adults 50-plus years of age were recruited through AIDS service organizations in Ohio and New York. Participants completed a neuropsychological battery and an audio computer-assisted self-interview. FIML SEM analyses revealed that neuropsychological functioning was not associated with adherence. Fit indices supported a stress and coping model, with negative affect mediating the effects of social support and maladaptive coping on ART adherence. Results were consistent with stress and coping models and suggest that interventions intending to increase adherence to ART in HIV-infected older adults may be more effective if they address negative affect and enhance adaptive coping and social support.",0,0,0,0
"Social support network structure in older people: Underlying dimensions and association with psychological and physical health. Social networks have been associated with a wide variety of health outcomes in older people. We examined the dimensions underlying the Wenger social support network type assessment to identify dimensions associated with mental and physical health. We interviewed 1334 community-dwelling participants aged 65+. The Geriatric Mental State automated geriatric examination for computer-assisted taxonomy interview was used to rate psychiatric symptoms and quality of life. Cognitive impairment was defined as a score of24 on the mini mental state examination. Clustering around latent variables identified two uncorrelated social support network domains: family (distance from and contact with relatives) and social engagement. Social engagement was associated with a lower age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of depression (odds ratio for a one-tertile increase 0.48), generalised anxiety disorder (OR 0.60), cognitive impairment (OR 0.68) and physical disability (OR 0.62) all p0.001. Adjusted for age, sex, depression, cognitive impairment and disability, the social engagement domain was also associated with better quality of life (OR 1.5) self-rated happiness (OR 1.3) and rating life as worth living (OR 1.4). The family domain, on the other hand, was not significantly associated with any health outcome. The results suggest that elective relationships and social engagement are the 'active ingredients' of social networks which promote health in later life.",1,0,0,0
"Awareness of pharmaceutical cost-assistance programs among inner-city seniors. Background: Lack of awareness may be a significant barrier to participation by low- and middle-income seniors in pharmaceutical cost-assistance programs. Objective: The goal of this study was to determine whether older adults' awareness of 2 major state and federal pharmaceutical cost-assistance programs was associated with the seniors' ability to access and process information about assistance programs. Methods: Data were gathered from a cross-sectional study of independently living, English- or Spanish-speaking adults aged ≥60 years. Participants were interviewed in 30 community-based settings (19 apartment complexes and 11 senior centers) in New York, New York. The analysis focused on adults aged ≥65 years who lacked Medicaid coverage. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model program awareness as a function of information access (family/social support, attendance at senior or community centers and places of worship, viewing of live health insurance presentations, instrumental activities of daily living, site of medical care, computer use, and having a proxy decision maker for health insurance matters) and information-processing ability (education level, English proficiency, health literacy, and cognitive function). The main outcome measure was awareness of New York's state pharmaceutical assistance program (Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage [EPIC]]) and the federal Medicare Part D low-income subsidy program (Extra Help). Results: A total of 269 patients were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 76.9 [7.5] years; 32.0% male; 39.9% white). Awareness of the programs differed widely: 77.3%) knew of EPIC! and 22.3% knew of Extra Help. In multivariable analysis, study participants were more likely to have heard of the EPIC program if they had attended a live presentation about health insurance issues (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.40; 95% CI, 1.20-9.61) and less likely if they received care in a clinic (AOR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23-0.92). Awareness of Extra Help in the multivariable models was more likely among study participants who had viewed a live health insurance presentation (AOR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.55-7.24) and less likely for those with inadequate health literacy (AOR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.74). Conclusions: Viewing of live health insurance presentations and adequate health literacy were associated with greater awareness of important pharmaceutical cost-assistance programs in this study in low-income, elderly individuals. The findings suggest that use of live presentations, in addition to health literacy materials and messages, may be important strategies in promoting knowledge of and enrollment in state and federal pharmaceutical cost-assistance programs for low-income seniors. © 2009 Excerpta Medica Inc.

"Confronting challenges in intervention research with ethnically diverse older adults: The USC Well Elderly II Trial. Background: Community-dwelling older adults are at risk for declines in physical health, cognition, and psychosocial well-being. However, their enactment of active and health-promoting lifestyles can reduce such declines. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to describe the USC Well Elderly II study, a randomized clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of a healthy lifestyle program for elders, and document how various methodological challenges were addressed during the course of the trial. Methods: In the study, 460 ethnically diverse elders recruited from a variety of sites in the urban Los Angeles area were enrolled in a randomized experiment involving a crossover design component. Within either the first or second 6-month phase of their study involvement, each elder received a lifestyle intervention designed to improve a variety of aging outcomes. At 4-5 time points over an 18-24 month interval, the research participants were assessed on measures of healthy activity, coping, social support, perceived control, stress-related biomarkers, perceived physical health, psychosocial well-being, and cognitive functioning to test the effectiveness of the intervention and document the process mechanisms responsible for its effects. Results: The study protocol was successfully implemented, including the enrollment of study sites, the recruitment of 460 older adults, administration of the intervention, adherence to the plan for assessment, and establishment of a large computerized data base. Limitations: Methodological challenges were encountered in the areas of site recruitment, participant recruitment, testing, and intervention delivery. Conclusions: The completion of clinical trials involving elders from numerous local sites requires careful oversight and anticipation of threats to the study design that stem from: (a) social situations that are particular to specific study sites; and (b) physical, functional, and social challenges pertaining to the elder population. © 2009 Sage Publications.",1,1,1,1
"Emergency medical service attitudes toward geriatric prehospital care and continuing medical education in geriatrics. OBJECTIVES: To understand the opinions of emergency medical service (EMS) providers regarding their ability to care for older adults, the domains of geriatric medicine in which they need more training, and the modality through which continuing education could be best delivered. DESIGN: Qualitative study using key informant interviews. SETTING: Prehospital EMS system in Rochester, New York. PARTICIPANTS: EMS providers, EMS instructors and administrators, emergency physicians, and geriatricians. MEASUREMENTS: Semistructured interviews were conducted using an interview guide that addressed knowledge and skill deficiencies, recommendations for improvement of geriatrics continuing education, and delivery methods of education. RESULTS: Participant responses were generally congruous despite the diverse backgrounds, and redundancy was achieved rapidly. All participants perceived a deficit in EMS education on the care of older adults, particularly related to communications with patients and skilled nursing facility staff. All desired more geriatric continuing education for EMS providers, especially in communications and psychosocial issues. Education was desired in various modalities. CONCLUSION: Further geriatric continuing education for EMS providers is needed. Some specific topics relate to medical issues, but a large proportion involve communications and psychosocial issues. Education should be delivered in a variety of modalities to meet the needs of the EMS community.

Eighteen participants (n = 18) who met inclusion criteria were recruited from a community health clinic, provided informed signed consent, and were assigned in groups of six to an Internetbased support group program. Where needed, participants were supplied equipment (computers, Web cams, audio headsets) and trained to access an easy-to-use, password-protected Web site that uses videoconferencing to support group member-facilitator interactive communication. The aim of the intervention was to support group member bonding and sharing of challenges and strategies for managing a chronic disease. Following 10 weekly professionally facilitated sessions, the groups met weekly in a self-help mode for an additional 3 months. Participants were interviewed at 6-month follow-up. An interview guide was used to gain feedback on using the Internet to access a health service and to ask about the benefits of having participated in the videoconferencing support group program. At follow-up, participants responded positively to using technology to communicate with healthcare professionals and other group members. They also valued the information shared regarding self-care, and reported reduction in feelings of loneliness and isolation. Our Internet-based, videoconferencing intervention program can be viewed as a prototype for designing technology platforms for the delivery of professional healthcare services to home-based older adults with chronic disease. © Copyright 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",1,1,1,0
"""Partnering with seniors for better health"": Computer use and internet health information retrieval among older adults in a low socioeconomic community. Purpose: This health communication project measured the psychosocial influences of computer anxiety, computer confidence, and computer self-efficacy in older adults at six meal congregate sites. The adults completed a five-week education intervention, based on Bandura's self-efficacy model, designed to assist older adults in retrieving and evaluating health information resources on the Internet. Methods: One hundred thirty-seven participants, ages sixty-five and older, were randomized in a controlled, two-group, pre-post, repeated measures design. Participants in the intervention group received a two-hour training session, once a week for five weeks. The Computer Confidence Subscale and Computer Anxiety Subscale of the Computer Attitude Scale and the Computer Self-Efficacy Measure were administered to both groups at three time intervals: at baseline, completion of the five-week intervention, and six weeks after completion of the intervention. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: Findings showed a reduction in computer anxiety and increases in computer confidence and computer self-efficacy in retrieving and evaluating online health information (P<0.001). Discussion: The study suggests an array of possibilities to engage older adults in the use of Internet health information resources to better contribute to their health, independence, safety, and wellness.",1,1,1,1
"Students’ Facebook ‘friends’: Public and private spheres. Friendship is highly significant during the university years. Facebook, widely used by students, is designed to facilitate communication with different groups of ‘friends’. This exploratory study involved interviewing a sample of student users of Facebook: it focuses on the extent to which older adults, especially parents, are accepted as Facebook friends, and the attitudes towards such friendships and potential friendships and what these reveal about notions of privacy. Parents were rarely reported to be Facebook friends, and there was a view that in general they would not be welcomed. The reasons were related to embarrassment, social norms, and worries about mothers. Underlying these were various notions of the private and the public. Students did not appear to conceive of there being two distinct realms: indeed, the ‘public’ appeared to be the individual's private social world. A level of sophistication is apparent, with nuanced understandings of concepts, suggesting that social networking sites such as Facebook are associated with new ways of construing some of the notions surrounding the traditional public/private dichotomy. Notions of what is private and what is public are fuzzy, with no clear-cut public/private dichotomy. Computer-mediated communication appears to make this fuzziness more apparent than has hitherto been the case. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",0,0,0,0
"Representing older people: Towards meaningful images of the user in design scenarios. Designing for older people requires the consideration of a range of design problems, which may be related to difficult and sometimes highly personal matters. Issues such as fear, loneliness, dependency, and physical decline may be hard to observe or discuss in interviews. Pastiche scenarios and pastiche personae are techniques that employ characters to create a space for the discussion of new technological developments and user experience. This paper argues that the use of fictional characters can help to overcome restrictive notions of older people by disrupting designers' prior assumptions. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences using pastiche techniques in two separate technology design projects that sought to address the needs of older people. In the first pastiche scenarios were developed by the designers of the system and used as discussion documents with users. In the second pastiche personae were used by groups of users themselves to generate scenarios which were scribed for later use by the design team. We explore how the use of fictional characters and settings can generate new ideas and undercut the potential in scenarios, for weak characterisation of 'the user' to permit scenario writers to fit characters to technology rather than vice versa. To assist in future development of pastiche techniques in designing for older people, we provide an array of fictional older characters drawn from literary and popular culture. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",1,0,0,0
"A single-user tabletop card game system for older persons: General lessons learned from an in-situ study. This paper discusses some general results from an in-situ study of the use of a tabletop system for card playing that differs in several ways from most tabletop systems: 1. It was designed primarily for use by senior citizens with little or no computer experience. 2. It is a single-user system, though social interaction with nearby persons during its use is typical. 3. It includes a simple conversational agent (representing the game's other player). 4. It is used in a setting (a senior citizens' center) in which the users also play cards in the traditional ways. A total of 42 regular visitors of the center participated over a 4-week period. From our observations and results, we draw several conclusions that should apply to other tabletop systems that share one or more of the characteristics just listed. © 2008 IEEE.",0,1,0,0
"Topological analysis of an online social network for older adults. Social network systems on the Internet, such MySpace and LinkedIn, are growing in popularity around the world. The level of such activity is now comparable to that associated with email and blogs. Our research addresses the question of whether people in different demographic groups use these systems in the same way. Older Americans tend to use email the same way as Americans in general. The usage of blogs, however, is different, with significant differences in the topological and structural patterns of post and response in blogs being evident in different demographics. We discover important information about the topological structures of online social networks by examining topological patterns in blog posts, also known as cascades. To accomplish this, we create and study the blogosphere, blog and post networks of an online social network used primarily by older adults. We also study the topological patterns of cascades in greater detail, reporting their common shapes, properties and size distribution. Our research has implications for the design of social network software for older Americans, as well as the algorithms used in search engines for such systems. Copyright 2008 ACM.",1,0,0,0
"The Active plus protocol: Systematic development of two theory- and evidence-based tailored physical activity interventions for the over-fifties. Background. Limited data are available on the development, implementation and evaluation processes of physical activity promotion programmes among older adults. More integrative insights into interventions describing the planned systematic development, implementation and evaluation are needed. Methods and design. The purpose of this study is to give an integrative insight into the development of the Active plus programme applying the six-step Intervention Mapping protocol. The Active plus programme consisted of two theory- and evidence-based tailored physical activity promotion interventions, both comprising three tailored letters delivered over four months and aimed at raising awareness of insufficient physical activity, and stimulating physical activity initiation and maintenance among the over-fifties. The first intervention, the basic tailored intervention, provided tailored letters that intervened on the psychosocial determinants of physical activity. The second intervention, the intervention plus, provided the same tailored information but additionally provided tailored information about physical activity opportunities in the specific environment in which the older adults lived. This environment-based component also provided access to a forum and e-buddy system on a website. A plan for implementation and evaluation is also described. Discussion. The planned development of the Active plus programme resulted in two theory- and evidence-based tailored physical activity interventions targeted at the over-fifties. Trial Registration.

"The Argentine-Spanish SF-36 Health Survey was successfully validated for local outcome research. Objective: To evaluate psychometric properties of the Argentine-Spanish SF-36 and to validate the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) measures. Study Design and Setting: A self-administration of the SF-36 with 1-year follow-up was performed in a University-based ambulatory center in Buenos Aires. Diagnoses were abstracted from the chart. Univariate analysis, psychometric methods, and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. Results: Of 3,290 subjects, 2,638 had computable scores and were included: 1,938 at their initial contact and 700 from a random sample of other enrollees. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.79 to 0.92 in all subscales except for General Health. Age was related to PCS scores (lower in the elderly) but not to MCS scores. PCS and MCS provided good discrimination among mutually exclusive disease categories; minor medical (52.2 vs. 51.1), psychosocial (48.1 vs. 43.0), chronic medical (46.2 vs. 51.0) and both chronic and mental conditions (44.9 vs. 45.1) in PCS and MCS, respectively (P < 0.01). Mean annual doctor visits increased from 3.6 to 5.3 in subjects with PCS > 55 and PCS < 35, and from 4.4 to 6.0 in subjects with MCS > 55 and MCS < 35, respectively (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: SF-36 is a valid tool for outcome research in Argentina although normative general population studies are needed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0,0,0,1
"Medical sociology: Modelling well-being for elderly people in Jamaica. Objective: Advances in nutrition, sanitation, water supply, technology and drugs have managed to add years to life. However, with the continuing increase in the non-communicable diseases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that disabilities have eroded nine years from the healthy quality of life of Jamaicans. The current study aims to provide factors that will explain how to attain 'good' health. Method: The research design for this study is an explanatory one. This research utilizes cross-sectional data taken from the Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions (JSLC) 2002 in order to identify and explain some of the determinants of well-being among the Jamaican elderly. Information collected used self-administered questionnaire. Multivariate regression was used to establish the well-being model. The surveyed population was 3009 respondents ages 60 years and older, with 52.7% females (n = 1423) and 47.3% males (n = 1423). The average age of the surveyed population was 71 years 10 months ± 8 years six months. Result: Of the 14 predisposed variables that were used to test the general hypothesis, 11 were found to be statistically significant. From the selected variables of this study, the six most important factors that impact on the well-being of the Jamaican elderly in descending order are as follows: social support (β = 0.486), average occupancy per room (β = -0.428), area of residence - living in Kingston Metropolitan Area (KMA) with reference to rural areas (β = 0.179) or dwelling in other towns with reference to rural area (β = 0.157), education (β = 0.155) followed by the physical environment (β = -0.138) and age of respondents (β = -0.129). Conclusion: The predisposed variables used in this study explain 45.9% of the variance in quality of life. The variable that has the most influential impact on well-being is social support. The general well-being of the Jamaican elderly is low (mean of 3.9/14 ± 2.3). The model provides a basis upon which we can address patient care and 'good' health.",1,0,0,1
"Social relationships and HRQL: A cross-sectional survey among older Italian adults. Background. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between social relationships and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) among the elderly in Italy. Methods. A sample of 33,744 Italian residents, representing the non-institutionalised population aged 60 years and over was extracted from the national ISTAT cross-sectional survey during 1999-2000. HRQL was measured with the SF-12, from which the Physical Component Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS) were obtained. Data were subjected to descriptive analysis and multiple logistic regression models with adjustment for the main confounders. Results. Our analysis shows a gradient in PCS and MCS among the terziles in seeing/meeting ""friends"" and ""family"" and, for PCS, a North-South gradient among the Italian regions. Females, the elderly who reported a lower household income, those who spent less time in recreational and religious activities, who lived too far from their relatives and had few relationships with friends and relatives, were significantly less likely to have an MCS above the median value. For PCS, an increase in HRQL was likely to be associated with a higher educational level, while lower PCS scores were associated with: age 75+, inadequate household income, unmarried status, infrequency of seeing/meeting friends, too high a mean distance from own home to relatives' homes, lack of leisure time spent in recreational activities, living in the Centre-South of Italy, chronic diseases, reduced autonomy, and use of drugs during the previous two days. Significant interactions between suffering from one chronic disease and the use of drugs were also found for both MCS and PCS. Conclusion. Some dimensions of social relationships were significantly associated with HRQL. These findings are crucial for devising welfare strategies at both the regional and the European level, i.e. in countries such as Italy where the primacy of family support of the elderly has declined in recent years. © 2008 de Belvis et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",1,0,0,1
"A challenge in academia: Meeting the healthcare needs of the growing number of older adults. Purpose: The purposes of this study were to survey nurse practitioners (NPs) to determine their comfort level with knowledge about caring for individuals aged 65 years and older and to obtain their input on enhancing geriatric content in the educational preparation of advanced practice nurses who provide care to older adults but are not specialists in gerontology. Data sources: The sample consisted of 500 randomly selected NPs who were certified to practice in New York State. The Geriatric Curriculum Survey designed by the researchers was based on the 47 ""Older Adult Care"" competencies developed by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. The survey was mailed to the subjects along with a stamped self-addressed envelope to facilitate its return. Two hundred and twenty-two surveys (44%) were returned. Conclusions: A majority of the respondents were comfortable with their assessment skill knowledge of individuals aged 65 years and older in all areas except those related to cultural/ethnic items. Over half of the respondents were only ""somewhat comfortable"" with knowledge of management of Alzheimer's disease, delirium, dementia, neurological problems, polypharmacy, and sleep issues. Finally, respondents were asked to rate their knowledge comfort level on topics relevant to physical and psychosocial issues of individuals aged 65 years and older. The majority of respondents only felt ""somewhat comfortable"" with their knowledge on all but one of the nine items in this category. Health promotion and disease prevention was the only item that over 50% of the respondents felt ""very knowledgeable"" about. Ninety-five percent indicated they would be better prepared to care for individuals aged 65 years and older if a didactic course in geriatrics was required in their program of study. Seventy percent indicated they would consider taking an online course in geriatrics. Implications for practice: Based on the results of this study, an online, four-credit geriatric-focused course ""Issues in Geriatric Management"" was developed. The course is required in the acute care and adult NP programs. Eventually, this course will be offered as continuing education credit for practicing NPs. The offering of a course focused on geriatrics will help to better prepare NPs to care for the growing number of elderly in this country. © 2008 American Academy of Nurse Practitioners.",0,0,0,1
"Family caregivers' future planning for younger and older adults with serious mental illness (SMI). This study examines plans for future caregiving made by family members of younger (n = 59) and older adults (n = 16) with serious mental illness (SMI). An online survey was advertised through a newsletter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Qualitative analyses yielded four areas of caregiver concern: health of the care recipient over time, ability of caregivers to sustain support, social support available for the care recipient, and financial burden of care. Despite these concerns, few caregivers reported completed plans for future caregiving. One fourth of the caregivers had made no plans, nor had they discussed future caregiving with others. Although most would prefer other relatives to assume care in the event they could not sustain support, these expectations may not be communicated openly. Generating discussion on this pertinent topic has implications for the aging society regarding how best to care for those with SMI and their caregivers. © 2008 The Southern Gerontological Society.",0,0,0,0
"A temporary home to nurture health: Lived experiences of older nursing home residents in Taiwan. Aim. This study explored the lived experiences of older nursing home residents in Taiwan. Background. With more long-term care institutions in Taiwan, older people are more often placed in nursing homes than in the past. Increased understanding of their lived experience is essential to assess residents' needs and determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions. Design. A qualitative design was used to gain a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of older nursing home residents in Taiwan. Methods. Focus groups, followed by in-depth interviews, were used to gather information from 33 older residents at eight nursing homes in northern Taiwan. Participants were asked to describe what was important to them and what impressed them most in their daily lives in the nursing home. Participants (24 females and nine males) were on an average 75.3 years old. Verbatim transcripts of audiotaped focus groups and interviews were analysed by thematic analysis via ATLAS.ti software. Results. The core theme of older residents' nursing home experience was 'a temporary home to nurture health'. This core theme was reflected in participants' descriptions of their overall life in the nursing home as a temporary experience to nurture their health. Their everyday experience was characterised by four subthemes: highly structured lifestyle, restricted activities, safety concerns and social interactions. Relevance to clinical practice. Our findings may enhance policy makers' and healthcare providers' understanding of the lived experience of older nursing home residents, thus guiding the evaluation and development of nursing home services to improve residents' lives. For example, residents with the same characteristics could be placed in the same room or same floor, thus increasing their interactions with other residents. Residents' interactions with family members could also be developed using the Internet or mobile telephones. © 2008 The Authors.",1,0,0,1
"Jumping to the next level: A qualitative examination of within-career transition in adolescent event riders. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the perceptions of a within-career transition, as experienced by adolescent athletes in the developmental stage of their careers. Design and method: Qualitative interviews were used to examine the perceptions of 10 young event riders who had made a transition to regional level. Interviews were based on the developmental model [Wylleman, P., & Lavallee, D. (2004). A developmental perspective on transitions faced by athletes. In Weiss, M. (Ed.), Developmental sport psychology. Morgantown, WV: Fitness Information Technology] and the model of human adaptation to transition [Schlossberg, N. (1981). A model for analyzing human adaptation. The Counseling Psychologist, 9(2), 2-18]. Data analysis procedures drew upon guidelines from Strauss, A. L., and Corbin, J. [(1998). Basics of qualitative research: Techniques and procedures for developing grounded theory (2nd ed.). Beverly Hills, CA: Sage] and Patton, M. Q. [(2002). Qualitative research and evaluation methods (3rd ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage]. Results and conclusion: Five categories have been identified (motivation for the transition, perceptions of the transition, sources of stress, support for athletic development, post-transition changes), which follow the process of transition as experienced by the athletes. Consistent with research, parents and peers were important at this stage, often prompting the motivation to make the transition, which was facilitated by considerable social support. Riders made considerable sacrifices during these adolescent years, and development in other areas (such as academic and social) was affected by this commitment, suggesting a risk for identity foreclosure at this formative time. Young athletes should be encouraged to develop a rounded identity to minimize the risk of foreclosure and the associated negative effects at retirement. Further within-career transition research is needed in order that programs can be designed which facilitate athlete development, mitigate negative influences, and minimize talent loss. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Qualified ageing workers in the knowledge management process of high-tech businesses. Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to aim to characterise the knowledge management process of the ageing human capital, within the sectors of aeronautics and bio-technologies in Canada. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology consists of: cross-search of literature towards the elaboration of a theoretical map; and collection of data involving semi-directed interviews followed by a thematic and statistical analysis of the textual data. Findings - Management's knowledge of social and relational knowledge, especially those of ageing workers, appears to be scarce, thus resulting in ageing workers being perceived as surpassed by technological and scientific progress. This conception deprives the company of an important source of knowledge capitalisation. A model relevant to the evaluation of company practices related to inter-generational aspects of knowledge management should include six basic dimensions, namely: management philosophy (a managerial style favouring projections and proximities), strategic analysis (knowledge, memory and learning strategy), organisational analysis (information management system and knowledge creation process), operational analysis (places of socialisation), competencies (relational and communicational know-how, individual memory and capacity of judgement), and the role of ageing personnel (activation of organisational and human resource networks). Research limitations/implications - Further validation is required across an enlarged population, with the aim of operationalising the observed concepts within a practical evaluation guide of company practices related to inter-generational aspects of knowledge management. Originality/value - By centering the analysis on highly qualified ageing individuals, the authors discerned a phenomenon showing that even within highly technological contexts knowledge management is far from systematically integrating those recognised a priori as carriers of knowledge.",1,0,0,1
"An Internet-based videoconferencing system for supporting frail elderly people and their carers. The ACTION project uses information and communication technology to support frail elderly people and their family carers. The aims are to enhance their quality of life, independence and preparedness and to break social isolation. A videoconferencing system, connecting homes and a call centre, was used in a pilot study in 1997-2002. A re-designed system was brought into use in late 2004 and over 60 new units were introduced during the first six months. The new system was evaluated with an interview study and by data logging. Eight family users and four professional carers were interviewed. The family users had used the videophone at least six times and they had had the equipment at home for at least two months. The average number of initiated calls per user was 5.7 per month and the average call time per user was 40 min per month. Seven of the users (88%) reported that the system very much reduced their sense of loneliness and isolation. The results of the evaluation were encouraging. There were several frequent users of videoconferencing. System quality was acceptable although a shorter audio delay would be desirable. The system was used regularly by the participants and it fulfilled its purpose.",1,1,1,0

"Self-reported lack of energy (anergia) among elders in a multiethnic community. Background. Lack of energy, ""anergia,"" is a possible central feature for identifying, evaluating, and treating elders with health-related problems in quality of life. Methods. A survey was conducted on a randomly selected stratified sample (N = 2130) of three ethnic groups of community-residing elders in a defined urban geographic area: the Northern Manhattan Aging Project (NMAP). The participants were Medicare beneficiaries living north of 150th Street in Manhattan. The criteria for anergia were based on the presence of the major criterion ""sits around a lot for lack of energy"" and any two of six minor criteria. Self-reports were gathered using a computer-assisted, rater-administered interview (the Comprehensive Assessment and Referral Interview; CARE) covering: function (basic activities of daily living [ADL] and instrumental ADL [IADL]); features of geriatric syndromes such as self-rated physical health, depression, pain, respiratory distress, trouble sleeping, cognitive impairment, and cardiovascular syndromes; social isolation; and healthcare utilization. Short-term (18-month) and long-term (6-year) mortality were derived from the National Death Index. Results. Three hundred eighty-six people (18% of the sample) met criteria for anergia. Anergia was more common in women than men (22% vs 12%, p &lt; .01), in unmarried than in married persons (21% vs 13%, p &lt; .001), and with advancing age. People with anergia used more hospitalizations, office visits, emergency room visits, and home care services and, had higher mortality rates. In multivariate analyses, the following factors had independent associations with anergia: female gender, impaired physical function and IADL, depression, pain, respiratory symptoms, urinary incontinence, hearing difficulty, feeling dizzy or weak, and social isolation and disengagement. These factors could be the initial candidates for clinical investigation of anergia of undetermined origin. Among people with anergia at baseline, 31.3% (n = 121) had persistent anergia and 33.9% (n = 131) recovered over a follow-up period of 18 months. Conclusions. Anergia in multiethnic older adults is associated with a range of clinical symptoms and diseases, with extensive health services use, and with increased mortality.

"The tule river tribal history project: Evaluating a California tribal government's collaboration with anthropology and occupational therapy to preserve indigenous history and promote tribal goals. Postcolonial and indigenous scholars suggest that creating alternative histories is a necessary activity for Native peoples in their recovery from the destructive emotional, behavioral, and political effects of colonial domination. The literature on history-making as a restorative process has focused on mental health, reversing negative representations of indigenous people in mainstream histories, and using Native histories to reclaim land and rights. In 2004, the Tule River Indian Tribe of Central California initiated an innovative history project to engage tribal elders in contributing historical information about themselves and their families for preservation by the Tribe. Theories and methods from postcolonial scholarship, anthropology, and occupational therapy (and its academic discipline occupational science) focused the Tule River Tribal History Project on providing meaningful and enjoyable activities - creating family trees, a tribal photo archive, interviews with elders, social gatherings and community discussions, and a website. The products were made available to participants in digital and printed formats. Copies have since been archived by the Tribal Council and also made available for tribal use at the Towanits Education Center on the Tule River Reservation. Pre-test and post-test survey data indicate: (1) the tribal elders' high valuation of the history-making activities; and (2) the positive impact of the program on social integration and spiritual well-being.

"Using the 12-item Short Form health survey (SF-12) to measure quality of life among older people. Aims: To present descriptive data, study psychometric abilities, and investigate the characteristics of non-respondents to SF-12. Method: The study had a randomized sample (n=4278; age: 75-105) stratified in four age groups. Factor analyses were performed to investigate the factor structure of the instrument, and convergent and discriminant validity was assessed by correlation between summary scores and by means of various measures (such as symptoms and ADL). Mean scores and Cronbach's alpha were computed for the total sample and for each stratum. Respondents and non-respondents to SF-12 were compared regarding various measures. A multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify determinants for respondents/non-respondents. Results: Mean scores in the total sample were 37.5 SD 11.9 for the physical component summary score (PCS) and 50.3 SD 11.5 for the mental component summary score (MCS). Both PCS and MCS decreased significantly with higher age. The instrument showed acceptable convergent/ discriminant validity and Cronbach's alpha, but the factor solution did not follow the intended structure of the instrument. Completion rate for all 12 items was 85.5% in the total sample, and the characteristics of non-respondents to SF-12 were higher age, being female, living alone, living in special accommodation, being worried about health, being in need of help with activities of daily living, reporting fewer symptoms, and having a smaller social network than respondents. Conclusions: The instrument generally showed acceptable validity and reliability, except for its factor structure. Furthermore, new determinants for non-respondents of SF-12 were found, such as type of living conditions, being worried about health, and social network. © 2007, Editrice Kurtis.",1,0,0,1
"Invisible jail: Providing housing and transportation for the elderly and disabled. In this chapter we look at how barrier-free and affordable housing and transportation services for elderly and disabled persons have generally not been developed.1 As we show later, very few books on housing address the considerable and important housing and transportation needs of the disabled and elderly. Here we will attempt to make this an important issue for progressive planning and housing. The elderly and disabled are often prevented from participating in employment, health care, shopping, social, and recreational activities, as well as exercising their freedom to live independently. Historically, our society has placed great emphasis on the institutionalization of elderly and disabled people who need assistance. This has relegated these people to environments that inhibit the development of selfsufficiency and community integration (Rosen, Clark, and Kivitz 1977). In many instances, terms or phrases used to describe these populations were developed to justify their exclusion from the larger society. For people with mental retardation, the words ""moron,"" ""imbecile,"" and ""retarded"" have been used. Each term creates its own stigma, which actually encourages people's isolation from society by its non-disabled and non-elderly members (Sarason and Doris 1979). There have always been calls for more progressive policies with regard to the habilitation of elderly people and those with disabling conditions. However, in most instances, these demands were made by a limited number of academics and social reformers. In the 1970s, however, the pressure for programs and policies that were intended to integrate handicapped and elderly people into society reached a new pinnacle. Political and economic factors, together with research findings suggesting the possibilities that exist for people with handicaps, have created a demand for more communitybased and socially integrated programs and policies. At the political level, court decisions that ruled institutions unfit required public action to develop community-based programs for many disabled people (see, for example, Lelsz v. Kavanagh, U.S. Court of Appeals, 5th Circuit, 85-2485 and 86-1166, reported January 21, 1987). The monetary costs of institutionalized programs, even in the face of lawsuits arguing the existence of inferior care, continued to rise and created another pressure for the development of alternative programs. In addition to these factors, older people and the disabled are more vocal in their support for independent living arrangements that take advantage of technology and innovative support systems. Their goal of being free in urban environments is actually made attainable as a result of a combination of housing and transportation design modifications and creative housing programs. In 1990, President George H. W. Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was seen as a civil rights victory for the disabled, many of whom are elderly. Disability is defined in the law as ""a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity."" As the population grows older, there is an ever-expanding need for more available slots in nursing homes for those people who are either unable to take care of themselves or have families who are unable or unwilling to take care of them. As it currently stands, there is a nursing home crisis in this country due to bed shortages and deplorable conditions that will continue to worsen in the years to come. In spite of this situation, legislatures around the country have turned their backs on this segment of the population, truly making them invisible. To a very real extent, the issue of a physical disability has always been a function of the state of technology. For example, without the advent of eyeglasses and hearing aids, many productive workers and family members would have to be considered disabled. Technological advances in transportation have also made it possible for individuals with limited physical strength to maneuver extremely large vehicles and aircraft. In a similar fashion, advances in wheelchair design, computers, and the construction of homes and buildings create the potential to make many people who were once disabled and dependent able and independent. The entire question of disability and dependency for the majority of people considered handicapped can be related to the application of existing technology. In recognition of the possibilities that exist, several groups have called for the development of accurate databases to describe existing housing and transportation problems that can thwart independent living for the elderly and disabled people (Harlow and Rosentraub 1984). A group of concerned citizens and public officials in Houston created a multi-institutional task force in 1985 to examine the state of housing and transportation for the elderly and the handicapped. The task force would develop plans and programs for improved social integration and access for all Houston citizens. This task force included members from the Area Agency on Aging, Harris County Community Development Agency, Houston Center for Independent Living, Housing Authority of the City of Houston, Sheltering Arms, City of Houston Planning and Development Department, Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority, Houston City Council, University of Houston, Texas Southern University, and the University of Texas at Arlington. This task force initiated a research project to assess the needs of disabled and elderly persons. The study involved interviews with more than 1,640 Houston/Harris County area residents who had special housing and transportation needs. This comprehensive study revealed certain facts with the potential of having a major impact on housing and transportation policy in the years ahead. The research also was passed along to Congress and the first President Bush in their debate concerning passage of the ADA. © 2008 by the University of Texas Press. All rights reserved.",1,0,0,0
"Living with seal robots - Its sociopsychological and physiological influences on the elderly at a care house. Robot therapy for elderly residents in a care house has been conducted since June 2005. Two therapeutic robots were introduced into a care facility, and activated for over 9 h each day to interact with the residents. This paper presents the results of the first month of this experiment. To investigate the psychological and social effects of the robots, each subject was interviewed, and their social network was analyzed. In addition, the activities of the residents in public areas were recorded by video cameras during daytime hours (8:30-18:00). For physiological analysis, residents' urine was obtained and analyzed for hormones 17-ketosteroid sulfate and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethical committee of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. The results indicate that interaction with the seal robots increased their social interaction. Furthermore, the urinary tests showed that the reactions of the subjects' vital organs to stress improved after the introduction of the robots. © 2007 IEEE.",1,1,1,0
"Promoting older adults' well-being through Internet training and use. The purpose of the current research was to test the psychological impact of learning how to use computers and the Internet in old age, hypothesizing that such activities would contribute to seniors' well-being and personal sense of empowerment. Employing a quasi-experimental research design, we offered a course, conducted in small groups, in computer operation and Internet browsing to 22 older adults (mean age of 80) who went to day-care centers for the elderly or resided in nursing homes. A comparison group of 26 participants (similar in all major respects) was engaged in other activities. Both groups were administered measures of physical functioning, life satisfaction, depression, loneliness and self-control at pre- and post-intervention four months later. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants who finished the computer course. ANCOVA was employed for controlling the effects of control variables and pre-intervention differences on participants who completed the activities. Results showed a significant improvement among participants in the intervention group in all measures except physical functioning, whereas deterioration in all measures was detected in the comparison group. Computer and Internet use seems to contribute to older adults' well-being and sense of empowerment by affecting their interpersonal interactions, promoting their cognitive functioning and contributing to their experience of control and independence. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.",1,1,1,0
"Escape loneliness by going digital: A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a Dutch experiment in using ECT to overcome loneliness among older adults. Background: This study evaluates the outcomes of an Internet-at-home intervention experiment that intended to decrease loneliness among chronically ill and physically handicapped older adults through introducing them to the use of an electronic communication facility. Method: To determine the effectiveness of the experiment in terms of reducing loneliness, 15 older adults were interviewed three times: shortly before the start, two years later and immediately after termination of the experiment, while their loneliness scores at zero and post-measurement were compared with those of a control group. Results: Both the participants and the control persons experienced a reduction in loneliness over time. However, the reduction was only significant for the intervention participants. Moreover, the changes in loneliness were significantly greater among the participants compared to the control persons. When looking more in detail, the effect of the experiment was only significant regarding emotional loneliness and among the highest educated. Findings of the qualitative research enabled us to understand the mechanisms through which the intervention helped alleviate loneliness. E-mail was found to facilitate social contact. Furthermore, the computer and Internet were often used to pass the time, taking people's minds off their loneliness. Unexpectedly, the intervention also improved people's self-confidence. Conclusion: The decline in loneliness is likely to be greater if persons under more favorable circumstances are selected and if more social functions of the Internet are used. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.",1,1,1,1
"Using the Internet for offline relationship formation. This study examines the impact of the Internet on the online and offline social interactions and relationships of members of a senior-oriented computer club. Twenty semistructured, openended interviews were conducted in February 2005 to collect data. Grounded theory was used to guide data analysis. Major findings include the following: First, within this particular group of older American Internet users, there is little online interaction. The Internet is used primarily as a handy tool to obtain information rather than for developing online relationships. Second, weak tie relationships that develop as a result of face-to-face interactions in computer club meetings facilitate the exchange of information among members. Third, social interactions in the offline environment also provide rich opportunities for older adults to form and maintain companionship relationships. These findings reveal a previously ignored phenomenon: In addition to creating online social relationships, the Internet can also affect relationship formation in the physical world. © 2007 Sage Publications.",1,0,0,0
"The impact of providing dental services to frail older adults: Perceptions of elders in adult day health centers. Very little is known about the oral health of, and access to, dental services among frail elders who live in the community and use an adult day health center (ADHC) for respite care. This pilot study evaluated the perceived oral health quality of life (OHQOL) of elders who used a mobile dental program in urban, suburban, and rural ADHC settings. Pre- and post-treatment interviews were conducted to evaluate OHQOL using the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). ADHC records were used to obtain demographic, medical history and medication data. Following initial dental examinations and consent, dental treatment was provided at each ADHC. Of the 138 elders screened at three ADHCs, pre- and post-treatment data were obtained on 76 subjects following their treatment (mean four months later). The group's members were mostly female (64.5%) and Caucasian (71.6%). Their mean age was 76.8 (+/- 9.8), with an average of 12.4 teeth (34.2% edentulous); 67.7% were on Medicaid. On average they had 5.5 chronic diseases, hypertension being the most common (67.1%); 44.8% had a neurological disorder or dementia. GOHAI scores were generally high both pre- and post-treatment, reflecting high physical and psychosocial OHQOL and low levels of worry. GOHAI scores were correlated with chronic diseases; the more chronic diseases an individual had, the lower his or her total score pre- and post-treatment (r=-.24, r=-.26 respectively, p<.04). The more dental treatment needs an elder had, the lower his or her GOHAI (r=-.23, p<.05). Elders with more teeth reported higher GOHAI pre- and post-treatment (r=.36, r=.37 respectively, p<.002). Paired t-tests comparing pre- and post-treatment GOHAI scores revealed significant improvements in overall GOHAI (p<.001), and on two dimensions: physical (p<.005) and psychosocial (p<.002). The findings support the importance of providing on-site access to dental services in order to maintain the general OHQOL of frail elders, more specifically in the areas of physical and psychosocial well-being.",1,1,1,0
"Factors associated with decline in physical functional health in a cohort of older women. Objective: to identify minimum criteria to assist the prediction of decline in physical health-related quality of life in the elderly. Study Design and Setting: participants were women from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health, who responded to three separate Surveys conducted in 1996 (when they were aged 70-75 years), 1999 and 2002. Using data from these Surveys, three categories were generated which described current physical health-related quality of life and future physical decline as measured by the physical component sumary score(PCS) of the MOS SF-36 quality of life survey. Results: bivariate analyses reported a large number of variables significantly associated with physical decline (P < 0.001), including age, falls, number of diagnoses, symptoms, doctor visits and medications, days spent in hospital, body mass index, living arrangements and social support. Multivariate analyses, using decision tree analysis, identified three items which accurately predicted 76% of the women who would exhibit physical decline according to our definition. Conclusions: this study identified a number of variables that may be useful in clinical screening for vulnerability to physical decline. © The Author 2007.

"The prevalence of depressive symptoms and other variables among frail aging men in New York City's Personal Care Services program. Background: New York City's Personal Care Service Program provides service-rich assistance to the frail elderly who would not be able to live at home without such support. However, gender-specific health care delivery has not been introduced. Depressive symptoms are common among elderly people. We conducted a cross-sectional study in order to investigate the prevalence of depressive symptoms and other variables among frail elderly men receiving personal care services. Methods: Data were collected from administrative data available in the Human Resources Administration's computer system. Two hundred men aged 65 or older were randomly selected. We defined depressive symptoms by tracking the recording of depressed mood in the data system. We examined statistical differences in a variety of indicators between elderly men with and without depressive symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine which independent variables were associated with depressive symptoms. Results: Of all cases, 10.5% had depressive symptoms. In multiple logistic regression models, the duration of services provision and hearing impairment were independently associated with depressive symptoms in frail elderly men. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate the low prevalence of depressive symptoms among frail elderly men compared with previous studies. The duration of services provision was a protective factor for depressive symptoms, i.e. personal care services provided high quality Activities of Daily Living (ADL) support, which keeps frail elderly men living at home for as long as possible. The significance of hearing impairment, which can induce social isolation, also needs to be stressed as an indicator of depressive symptoms, even though there was no discrete measurement of social isolation included in the data. © 2007 WPMH GmbH.",1,0,0,1
"Rural parents with urban children: Social and economic implications of migration for the rural elderly in Thailand. The present study explores the social and economic consequences of the migration of adult children to urban areas for rural parents in Thailand. Attention is given to the circumstances under which such migration takes place, including the role parents play in the process and the extent to which the implications of migration for the parents are taken into consideration. The analysis relies primarily on open-ended interviews conducted in 2004 with older age parents with migrant children in four purposely selected rural communities that were studied ten years earlier. Our findings suggest that migration of children to urban areas contributes positively to the material well-being of their elderly parents who remain in rural areas. Negative impacts of migration on social support, defined in terms of maintaining contact and visits, have been attenuated by the advent of technological changes in communication and also by improvements in transportation. Phone contact, especially through mobile phones, is now pervasive, in sharp contrast to the situation ten years earlier when it was extremely rare. Much of the change in Thailand in terms of the relationships between rural parents and their geographically dispersed adult children is quite consistent with the concept of the 'modified extended family', a perspective that has become common in discussions regarding elderly parents in industrial and post-industrial societies but rarely applied to the situation of elderly parents in developing country settings.

"Effects of hostility on the risk of arterial hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke in a sample of males aged 25-64 years (epidemiological trial on the base of WHO program MONICA). Aim. To study effects of hostility on the risk of arterial hypertension (AH), myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in males aged 25-64 years. Materials and methods. A screening study of the population was performed in 1994 according to WHO program MONICA-psychosocial. The response in a random representative sample of 25-64-year-old males (n = 657) living in Novosibirsk was 82.1%. New cases of MI, AH and stroke were registered in the control periods 1994-2000, 1994-2002. Computer program package SPSS-10 was used for statistic processing. Cox regression model of the relative risk (RR) was employed. Results. Hostility was rather prevalent among the examinees (76.9%). MI risk for 8 years was 4.65 times higher in hostile men. Hostility was not associated with higher risk of AH and stroke. Hostility was seen more frequently in men with poor education, workers and retired persons. These groups are also at the highest risk of MI. Conclusion. Hostility raises MI risk in unstable society but had no effect on the risk of AH and stroke.",0,0,0,1
"Determinants of cardiovascular disease and other non-communicable diseases in Central and Eastern Europe: Rationale and design of the HAPIEE study. Background: Over the last five decades, a wide gap in mortality opened between western and eastern Europe; this gap increased further after the dramatic fluctuations in mortality in the former Soviet Union (FSU) in the 1990s. Recent rapid increases in mortality among lower socioeconomic groups in eastern Europe suggests that socioeconomic factors are powerful determinants of mortality in these populations but the more proximal factors linking the social conditions with health remain unclear. The HAPIEE (Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern Europe) study is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the effect of classical and nonconventional risk factors and social and psychosocial factors on cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases in eastern Europe and the FSU. The main hypotheses of the HAPIEE study relate to the role of alcohol, nutrition and psychosocial factors. Methods and design: The HAPIEE study comprises four cohorts in Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania; each consists of a random sample of men and women aged 45-69 years old at baseline, stratified by gender and 5 year age groups, and selected from population registers. The total planned sample size is 36,500 individuals. Baseline information from the Czech Republic, Russia and Poland was collected in 2002-2005 and includes data on health, lifestyle, diet (food frequency), socioeconomic circumstances and psychosocial factors. A short examination included measurement of anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, lung function and cognitive function, and a fasting venous blood sample. Re-examination of the cohorts in 2006-2008 focuses on healthy ageing and economic well-being using face-to-face computer assisted personal interviews. Recruitment of the Lithuanian cohort is ongoing, with baseline and re-examination data being collected simultaneously. All cohorts are being followed up for mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events. Discussion: The HAPIEE study will provide important new insights into social, behavioural and biological factors influencing mortality and cardiovascular risk in the region. © 2006 Peasey et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",0,0,0,1
"A telephone-delivered coping improvement group intervention for middle-aged and older adults living with HIV/AIDS. Background: By 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts that 50% of all cases of HIV/AIDS in the United States will be in persons 50 years of age or older. Purpose: This pilot research tested whether a 12-session, coping improvement group intervention delivered via teleconference technology could improve life quality in 90 middle-age and older adults living with HIV/AIDS. Method: This research used a lagged-treatment control group design. Forty-four HIV-infected persons 50-plus years of age participated in a coping improvement group intervention immediately after study enrollment, whereas 46 individuals received the intervention after their time-matched immediate treatment participants completed the intervention. Participants completed self-administered surveys that assessed depressive and psychological symptoms, life-stressor burden, ways of coping, coping self-efficacy, and loneliness. Results: Outcome analyses indicated that, compared to their delayed treatment counterparts, immediate treatment participants reported fewer psychological symptoms, lower levels of life-stressor burden, increased coping self-efficacy, and less frequent use of avoidance coping. After receiving the intervention, delayed treatment participants reported greater coping self-efficacy and less psychological symptomatology, life-stressor burden, and loneliness. However, the intervention demonstrated little ability to reduce depressive symptoms in this sample of HIV-infected older adults diagnosed with depression. Conclusions: Although findings from this research suggest that telephone-delivered, coping improvement group interventions have potential to facilitate the adjustment efforts of HIV-infected older adults, more rigorous evaluations of this intervention modality for this group are needed. © 2006 by The Society of Behavioral Medicine.",0,1,0,1
"Rehabilitative therapy for the elderly chronic somatic disease complicated with depression. Background: There is a complicated relation between somatic disease and mental disorder. Somatic disease may induce functional disorder of brain, and generate psychiatric symptoms due to the change of psychological and social environment. The proportion of depression in elder people based on the chronic somatic disease is much higher, and thus the fatality of them increases. Objective: To investigate the influence of single antidepressant, and therapeutic alliance of psychological and drug treatment on the rehabilitation of patients with elderly chronic somatic disease complicated with depression. Design: Randomized and controlled grouping experiment. Setting: Department of Senile Disease of Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Participants: Totally 10 2 patients were hospitalized in the Department of Senile Disease of Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Huazhong University of Science and Technology from March 2000 to January 2003, and all the patients had sleep disorder to a different extent, and suffered from symptoms of heart and alimentary tract which could not be explained as organic diseases, and chronic pain or systemic symptom. Their score of Zung scale was > 40 points with average of (48.83±4.15) points. The patients were randomly divided into the drug group (n=46) and the combined treatment group (n=56). Each patient had more than two somatic symptoms in the two groups and more than 81.0% of them had three somatic symptoms. Methods: According to the different primary diseases in patients of the two groups, regular treatment was given routinely. Oral thymoleptics fluoxetine of 20 mg/d 5-hydroxyltryptamine reuptake restrainer with 20 mg/d was administered, the dose of which could be added to 40 mg/d according to the pathogenetic conditions. At the beginning of the administration of oral antidepressant drugs, the patients in the combined treatment group were given the effective psychological direction immediately, which included: 1 The focal point of depression and fear was identified, and the comfort and psychological aid were given to reduce the anxiety. 2 The basic knowledge related to the disease was supplied, and the pathogenetic condition and the prognosis were told to the patients objectively. The family and society were encouraged to learn the rehabilitative skill and improve their self-care ability of daily life. 3 Demand of patient was satisfied as far as possible, and the family and society were encouraged to give the patients adequate psychological support and life support. The patient and the family were assisted to establish favorable communication. The feeling of loneliness and isolation was reduced, and the sense of safety was increased. The depression status and the quality of life of the patients in the two groups were evaluated before the treatment and at 2 and 8 weeks after treatment with the Zung scale and the Spitzer quality of life index score (QLI), including 5 aspects: Activity, daily life, health, support and perspective. The highest score was 10 points. The lowest was 0, and the higher the score, the better the quality of life is. Main outcome measures: The results of the Zung scale and the QLI score evaluated before the treatment and at 2 and 8 weeks after the treatment. Results: The treatment of the patients in the two groups was all finish ed and all of them entered the result analysis. 1 The total points of Zung scale in the drug group and the combined treatment group at 2 weeks after the treatment indicated that there was significant difference in comparison with those before the treatment (41.12±2.60, 48.83±4.15, t =10.67, P<0.05); (40.88±3.43, 49.03±4.21, t=11.24, P<0.05). There was not significant difference in group comparison. The total points of Zung scale at 8 weeks were significantly decreased (36.11±2.87), (30.71±3.62), and there was significant difference in comparison with that before the treatment. The combined treatment group was better than the drug group in group comparison at 8 weeks after treatment. 2 there was no significant difference of QLI score at 2 weeks between the drug group and combined treatment group before and after the treatment (5.47±1.33, 5.32±1.04, 5.55±1.18, 5.27±1.35). The QLI score of drug group and combined treat merit group at 8 weeks after treatment began to rise 7.21±0.13 and 8.83 ±0.32, respectively, and there was significant difference in comparison with those before the treatment, and there was also significant difference in group comparison. Conclusion: The positive and effective combined therapy of anti-depression significantly improved the somatic symptoms of patients, no complications appeared, and most patients presented optimistic attitude to the prognosis of the primary disease. To identify the depression of elder people in earlier period is very important to promote rehabilitation of the primary disease.",1,1,1,1
"Food insecurity in community-dwelling older Australians. Objective: To identify the extent of food insecurity (defined as running out of food in the last 12 months and being unable to afford to buy more) amongst older Australians, and the characteristics of those who experience this condition, Design: Cross-sectional population survey. Setting and subjects: Respondents (n = 8881) were community-dwelling older people (65 years and older) living independently in New South Wales, Australia, randomly sampled to participate in a computer-assisted telephone interview conducted during 1999-2000. The response rate was 71%. Responses to a food insecurity questionnaire item were collected along with sociodemographic information, living arrangements, lifestyle and self-rated health. Univariate analyses and logistic regression modelling of factors for reporting food insecurity were conducted. Results: Approximately one in 50 older people reported experiencing food insecurity in the previous 12 months attributable to inadequate finances. The analyses revealed that those at risk can be identified as more likely to report poorer health, limited financial resources, not owning their own home and living alone. Gender and age differences were also evident. Conclusion: While only a minority of older Australians reported experiencing food insecurity attributable to inadequate finances, such people are at higher risk of malnutrition and associated morbidity. Food insecurity is an important public health and equity issue in older people that can be addressed through implementing appropriate income and social support policies. © The Authors 2006.",1,0,0,1
"From clinical activities to didactics and research in Occupational medicine. Background: The daily practice of Occupational Physicians in the mot industrialized countries suggests that the frequency of traditional occupational diseases is progressively lowering, their gravity is decreasing, and the etiological factors are changing. This trend should be quantitatively and qualitatively verified with ad hoc studies. The information is particularly relevant for Academic Institutions where medical students and residents in occupational medicine are trained. Objectives: To analyse the trends of clinical diagnoses and health surveillance activities conducted in the last 15 years by an Italian Institute of Occupational Health, and to gain information on the most relevant topics to be taught in academic program and to be addressed with future research. Methods: Data sources were represented by the computerised registration of a) diagnostic activities and b) health surveillance programs, conducted by the Institute of Occupational Medicine of the University of Brescia, a highly industrialized area in Northern Italy. The observation period was from 1990 to 2005. The health surveillance programs regarded workers pulled from an iron foundry, a veterinary institute, a health departments for the assistance of elderly subjects, a nursery schools and a municipal department for road maintenance. Results: Diagnostic activities were conducted on 9080 subjects, who had been referred for suspected occupational disease. The diagnosis of occupational disease was confirmed for 3759 cases. Multiple diseases were diagnosed in 1554 subjects, yielding the total number of 5721 occupational diseases. The most frequent diagnoses accounted for allergic skin disease (23.4%), followed by pneumoconiosis (20.4%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15.9%), noise hearing loss (7.1%), musculoskeletal disorders (6.9%), respiratory allergies (6.9%), cancer (5.9%), miscellaneous (6.4%). When limited to the last quinquennium, the analysis showed a definite increase of muskuloskeltal disorders, cancer, and, although at a lesser extent, diseases due to psychosocial factors. The analysis of the health surveillance programs regarded 1207 workers, and showed that various non occupational diseases caused limitation to individual work fitness. The most frequent conditions were musculoskeletal disorders (65%) and skin diseases (14%). Conclusions: The results from these two investigations are important not only for the didactic program run by the Institute, but also because they indicate the most relevant topics to be addressed with future research, at least at a local level.",0,0,0,1
"Global sleep satisfaction of older people: The Jerusalem cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To describe the nature of global sleep satisfaction (GSS) of older people and the factors associated with it. DESIGN: A 7-year follow-up of an age-homogenous cohort. SETTING: Community based. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred ninety subjects aged 70 at baseline and 77 at follow-up. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported sleep domains and a comprehensive assessment of health variables, including psychosocial, physical, and functional factors, at ages 70 and 77. RESULTS: GSS was found to be poor in 25% of subjects at ages 70 and 77, with an estimated average annual remission rate of 7% and an annual incidence of 2.4%. Poor GSS at ages 70 and 77 was significantly associated with difficulty falling asleep, awakening feeling tired, two or more nocturnal awakenings, and taking sleeping tablets. Significant cross-sectional associations were found at age 70 and 77 between poor GSS and poor self-rated health, general fatigue, depression, dependence in one or more activities of daily living, and low level of physical activity. In a regression analysis, risk factors at age 70 for subsequent poor GSS were loneliness, depression, poor self-rated health, economic difficulties, back pain, obesity, and prior poor GSS. The only significant long-term association was between poor GSS and poor self-rated health. GSS did not influence mortality data. CONCLUSION: Poor GSS in older people is common and chronic. Its chief determinants are loneliness, depression, poor self-rated health, economic difficulties, back pain, and obesity. It predicts poor self-rated health but not increased mortality. © 2006, Copyright the Authors.",1,0,0,1
"Caring for others: Internet video-conferencing group intervention for family caregivers of older adults with neurodegenerative disease. Purpose: The aim of this pilot feasibility study was to evaluate the effects of an innovative, Internet-based psychosocial intervention for family caregivers of older adults with neurodegenerative disease. Design and Methods: After receiving signed informed consent from each participant, we randomly assigned 66 caregivers to an Internet-based intervention or to a no-intervention control group. The intervention group received computers and training in order to access a password-protected Web site with links to information, e-mail, and threaded discussion. Unique to the Web site was a video-conferencing link that supported caregivers' participation in a 10-session, manual-guided psychosocial support group, followed by 12 additional online sessions facilitated by a group member. Participants completed health-status and stress-response measures at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Results: Content analysis of archived video sessions showed (a) reliable adherence to the manual-guided support-group intervention and (b) online group discussion themes similar to those in face-to-face caregiver support groups. Analyses of stress-response outcome data showed significant between-group differences, with the intervention group experiencing a decline in stress compared with an escalation in stress for the control group. Implications: Despite the limitations of this pilot study in terms of limited sample size and 54% dropout of control participants at 6-month follow-up, the results provide preliminary supportive evidence for a technology-based psychosocial intervention for family caregivers of individuals with neurodegenerative disease.

"Resource planning for patient-centered, collaborative care. In this article, we use self-reported information from 13,271 older adults and the results from several controlled trials to construct a planned-care management strategy that cuts across diseases and conditions and also addresses health disparities attributed to low socioeconomic status. Three strata result from the interaction of patients' financial status, the presence or absence of bothersome pain and psychosocial problems, and their confidence with self-care. A majority of ambulatory patients generally fall in the first stratum. More resources are required in the 2 remaining strata to attain patient-centered, collaborative care. Because the planned-care management strategy is behaviorally sophisticated, it is likely to be more efficient and effective than strategies based on concepts of disease management that focus on either a single disease or groupings of patients who are ""high utilizers"" of healthcare. We conclude that modern technologies and related approaches make resource planning for patient-centered, collaborative care feasible and desirable. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",1,1,1,0
Impact of monitoring technology in assisted living: Outcome pilot. This paper describes a study designed to assess the acceptance and some psychosocial impacts of monitoring technology in assisted living. Monitoring systems were installed in 22 assisted living units to track the activities of daily living (ADLs) and key alert conditions of residents (15 of whom were nonmemory care residents). Activity reports and alert notifications were sent to professional caregivers who provided care to residents participating in the study. Diagnostic use of the monitoring data was assessed. Nonmemory care residents were surveyed and assessed using the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) instrument. Pre- and post-installation SWLS scores were compared. Older adult participants accepted monitoring. The results suggest that monitoring technologies could provide care coordination tools that are accepted by residents and may have a positive impact on their quality of life. © 2006 IEEE.,1,1,1,0
"Active early retirement: The demands, needs and interests of persons taking early retirement from the mining industry in Asturias (Spain) [Prejubilación activa: Demandas, necesidades e intereses de las personas prejubiladas de la minería asturiana]. Objectives: to detect and analyse the demands, needs and interests of persons taking early retirement from the mining industry in Asturias. Material and methods: three lines of investigation were developed: a) qualitative research to analyse early retirement in Asturias, which employed the techniques of in-depth interview and group discussion, b) group workshops for individuals taking early retirement from the mining industry, and c) a register of a questionnaire about interests. Results: there are certain aspects to early retirement from mining that were viewed as highly positive, for example, better health and safety. However, demands also arise caused by a lack of personal skills to enable reorganisation of a new rhythm of daily life, as well as the absence of a social role. Some of the needs identified were related to the individual (preparation for coping with a new situation, training to acquire skills leading to healthy, meaningful occupation). Others were more at the group level, such as the need for collective meetings and for roles that involve social acknowledgement. The interests detected (training, leisure time and voluntary work) were grouped as follows: new technologies, social communication, social support, handicrafts, health, environment and tradition. Conclusions: early retirement processes should be linked to psychological and social preventive action dealing with issues such as preparation for a new situation, training in skills to enable meaningful occupation and healthy habits, and channelling of this collective towards social activities of significance to the community.",0,0,0,1
"Longitudinal study of individuals with high tetraplegia (C1-C4) 14 to 24 years postinjury. Individuals with hightetraplegia, C1-C4, are living longer due to improvements in medical and rehabilitation care, as well as technology. It is unclear whether this increased longevity is associated with good subjective quality of life and full participation in family and community living. This study describes the outcomes of a group of 63 individuals with high tetraplegia who were interviewed at three phases: 5.3 ± 2.4 years, 13.1 ± 2.5 years, and 18.9 ± 2.6 years postinjury. The measures included demographics, characteristics of assistance with care, psychosocial variables, and time utilization. The results indicate that this group of individuals with high tetraplegia appeared to be functioning well in most areas of their lives. For those indicators that showed change over time, the SCI itself, not necessarily a high tetraplegic injury, and/or the aging process could account for the change. This study suggests that increases in longevity have provided individuals with high tetraplegia the opportunity to live rich and fulfilled lives. © 2005 Thomas Land Publishers, Inc.",0,0,0,0
"Mental health care in Madrid. Aim. - To describe principles and characteristics of mental health care in Madrid. Method. - Based on existing data, service provision, number of professionals working in services, funding arrangements, pathways intocare, user/carer involvement and specific issues are reported. Results. - In Madrid, mental health services are organized into 11 zones/areas, divided into 36 districts, where there is a mental healthoutpatient service with a multi-disciplinary team. Home treatment and psychosocial rehabilitation services have been developed. Specialist programmes exist for vulnerable client groups, including Children and Adolescents, Addiction/Alcohol and Older People. The Madrid Mental Health Plan (2003-2008) is regarded as the key driver in implementing service improvement and increased mental health and well-being in Madrid. It has a meant global budget increase of more than 10% for mental health services. Results of the first 2 years are: an increase in mental health staff employed (17%), four new hospitalization units, 50% increase in places for children and adolescents Day Hospitals, 62 new beds in long care residential units, development of specific programmes for the homeless and gender-based violence, a significant investment in information systems (450 new computers) and development of best practice and operational guidelines. Mental health system was put to the test with Madrid's March 11th terrorist attack. A Special Mental Health Plan for Affected people was developed. Discussion - Unlike some European countries, public mental health service is the main heath care provider. There are no voluntary agenciescollaborating with mental health care. Continuity of care and coordination between all mental health resources is essential in service delivery. Increased demand of care for minor psychiatric disorders, children and adolescent mental health care, and implementation of rehabilitation and residential facilities for chronic patients are outstanding challenges similar to those in other European capitals. Overall, the mental health system had successfully coped with last year's increased care demand after March 11th terrorist attack in Madrid. © 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.",0,0,0,1
"Depression in older people in rural China. Background: In Western countries depression is the most common psychiatric condition in older persons and related to low socioeconomic status and low social supports. Along with social deprivation, the rural communities in China retain many Chinese traditions that involve high levels of social supports. Studying such a population might offer insights into the cause and prevention of depression that may be applicable in developing and developed countries. Methods: Using a cross-sectional, household-based, community survey in rural China, we aimed to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for depression among older people who had a low income (mean annual per capita income of about US $280) and high social support in 16 villages in Anhui Province. Participants included 754 men and 846 women aged 60 years or older. Depression was diagnosed using the Geriatric Mental State and the Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy. Risk factors, collected from the standard questionnaire and physical measurements, were examined in a stepwise multiple logistic regression model. Results: The prevalence of depression (world age standardized) was 6.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8%-7.3%). Of all persons, 1374 older persons (85.9%) living with family members. Depression was significantly and independently associated with female gender, low family income, lack of social support, relationship problems, poor health status, and adverse life events in the past 2 years. The risk of depression increased in those eating meat less than once a week (multiple-adjusted odds ratio, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.20-4.03), not watching television (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.00), and having undetected hypertension (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.05-3.01). Conclusions: Older people in rural China have a lower risk of depression than those in Western countries. Low socioeconomic status showed a ""dose-response"" relationship with depression, and social supports were much more common, which were protective for depression. Further exploration of Chinese culture and tradition may yield universal insights into preventive factors for depression in older people. ©2005 American Medical Association.

"Design and pilot results of a single blind randomized controlled trial of systematic demand-led home visits by nurses to frail elderly persons in primary care [ISRCTN05358495]. Background: The objective of this article is to describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients. Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",1,1,1,1
"Media mix elements that motivate online shopping. In light of projected labor shortages in key industries and underfunded retirement plans, this study investigated the reasons some older employees choose to continue working past their retirement-eligibility dates. Using a sample of 15 workers ages 52 to 67 and a qualitative interview methodology, the authors determined that retention of employer-provided health care benefits may be a critical factor in encouraging older workers to remain on the job. Further, workers in this sample highly valued the opportunity for positive social interaction on their jobs and indicated that more flexible work schedules would be one change the employer could make that would have the most immediate impact on their decision to retire. They also said that more money, more recognition/appreciation, more autonomy, and more opportunities to develop skills and knowledge would potentially keep them on the job longer. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications for practice and research. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.",0,0,0,0
"Linking survey data with computerised records to predict consulting by older people. Despite high consultation rates, little is known about predictors of primary care use by older people. A survey of patients aged ≥65 years from two London practices included details on physical health and functioning, psychological measures, social support, and socioeconomic measures. The response rate was 75% (1704/2276). We obtained consent to link the survey data to subjects' computerised primary care records for 92% (1565/1704) of responders. Individual factors (physical ill health, anxiety, female sex), social factors (frequent telephone contact with friends or family), and practice factors independently predicted consultation in the year post survey. Although physical ill health was the most important, the other factors had independent effects and may be useful in understanding the increase in consulting by older people. © British Journal of General Practice.",1,0,0,0
"Elder participation in cyberspace: A qualitative analysis of Israeli retirees. As computer networking becomes increasingly important, it is crucial to examine how this technology is used by the older generation. The present inquiry considers the nature and meaning of elder participation in cyberspace and the degree to which computer-mediated communication increases the social capital of older adults. The study compares 10 elder computer participants and 10 nonparticipants by means of open-ended interviews. Three primary themes emerged from the interviews. The first concerns the different conceptions of old age held by the cyber-participants and the nonparticipants, and in particular, differing views on learning capacity in later life. The second is related to the varying conceptions of time in old age, and orientation to the past or to the future. The third theme relates to the way in which the elderly persons involved in the virtual world relate to their computer, attributing human qualities to this new addition to their social network. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

"Three year health outcomes among older women at risk of elder abuse: Women's Health Australia. Background: Older women are at increasing risk of various forms of familial violence, yet detection is poor and very little is known of the longterm health effects of this psychosocial problem. The effectiveness of the 'Vulnerability to Abuse' Screening Scale (VASS) in predicting three year health outcomes was investigated among women enrolled in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health, now known as Women's Health Australia. Methods: The sample comprised a cohort of 10,421 women aged 73-78 who completed the 1996 and 1999 postal surveys (attrition rate 19.5%). The Time 2 sample had a small bias towards lower risk for elder abuse at Time 1 and better health on SF-36 and self-rated health. The VASS is a 12-item self-report measure with 4 factors: vulnerability, coercion, dependence and dejection. Results: Overall, physical health (PCS) declined while mental health (MCS) increased over the three year period. Decline in physical health was predicted by only the dejection factor, but not by factors which seem to more directly measure abuse. The predictive validity of the VASS for three year mental health outcomes was given partial support. Three of the four VASS factors (dejection, vulnerability, and coercion) predicted decline in mental health at the univariate level, however, after adjusting for confounders, only one VASS factor (dejection) independently predicted decline in mental health. Conclusions: While the VASS shows some promise as a marker of health risk in older women, only the dejection factor proved consistently predictive of declining health status. Further research is needed to determine longer term predictive validity of the scale and to gain a clearer picture of how abusive experiences impact on older women's health.",1,0,0,1
"Older people with depression: Pilot study. Background. Although a substantial number of studies have identified the prevalence of depression experienced by older adults living in the community and the factors that may precipitate this depression, few have focussed on depression in older people who attend day centres. Consequently, there is no literature suggesting how depression in this population may be psychologically managed. Aims. The aim of this paper is to present the results of a pilot study investigating the incidence of depression in people attending a London Age Concern day centre, and its associations with perceptions of handicap, loneliness, social support networks, satisfaction with social support, and satisfaction with life. Methods. A quasi-experimental, cross-sectional pilot study was conducted with attendees at a London Age Concern day centre between November 1998 and January 1999. The day centre manager selected a convenience sample of 24 of 156 participants. Inclusion criteria were that participants must attend the day centre regularly and be over or equal to 65 years of age. The exclusion criterion was known psychiatric illness. Participants were interviewed using the Geriatric Mental State-Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy, which identifies caseness of psychopathology and includes a loneliness subscale, and completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale, Social Support Questionnaire and London Handicap Scale. Results. There was a higher level of depression in this day centre setting than that found in other community-based studies. There were the expected significant associations between depression and loneliness, and depression and satisfaction with life. However, unexpectedly, there were no associations between depression and social support, or depression and handicap. Conclusions. The study has several limitations. However, the high level of depression and significant relationships between depression, loneliness and satisfaction with life may indicate that the social function of day centres is not meeting expectations. This suggests that there could be a role for community mental health nurses in offering psychosocial interventions to alleviate some of the distress experienced.",1,0,0,1
"Validation of the violence acceptance scale and rape myths in university students [Validación de las escalas de aceptación de la violencia y de los mitos de violación en estudiantes universitarios]. Introduction: At the present time, in spite of the beginning of a new century, characterized by considerable advances in science and technology, our societies have not been able to solve many of the serious problems affecting the social relationships and the development of people. Among these, we can point out, for instance, the extreme poverty and violence in their different modalities. Nowadays this seems an accepted form of social coexistence. For many inhabitants in the world, it has become part of daily life; and it seems that we have learned how to live with it, or rather, how to survive with it. In our daily lives, there seems to be a violence acceptance and tolerance which appears to be strongly allowed by cultural values which consider it as a valid and even natural way to manage conflicts. These values can become standards that reinforce men's domain over women, children and the elder. In addition, they may hold up the use of excessive force towards citizens on behalf of ""governability"" and the confrontation between groups with ideological, economic or political differences. In this violence-tolerant context, there is a kind of violence which is aimed specifically at women due to the inequal relationship between men an women maintained by gender roles existing in our societies. By socializing men and women as contraries, only one group holds up the power, thus generating the conditions and reproduction of violence that, in the case of women, frequently crosses the border of sexuality. Sexual violence is a mostly masculine form of violence that works as a mechanism which limits and impedes the development of women in public settings. The lack of information and the silence around this kind of violence contribute to keep it hidden and minimized, for what erroneous beliefs have been generated regarding their causes. This type of beliefs are known as ""rape myths"", and they have been constituted mainly as a research line in the United States and Canada. The objective of the present work is to show the construct's validity and the Acceptance of the Violence and Rape Myths scale's reliability in a sample of university students. Method: An evaluative comparative, transversal, ex post facto study was carried out using an intentional non-probabilistic sample of 300 university students from three different departments, 40% of them where male and 60% female from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The instruments used where Velicer's Violence Acceptance Scale (38) and the Scale of Acceptance of Myths of Violation built up taking as a base the eight original items of the scale of Burt (5) and 4 of the scale of Struckman-Johnson (32). Results: The general measurements of the Violence Acceptance Scale reactives show an inclination to disagree with the use of violence as a way to solve conflicts but, at the same time, it shows a tendency to agree with ""the use of military violence in international interventions"" and with ""the necessity of manufacturing weapons"". In the case of the Rape Myth Acceptance, it was appreciated that the general means where slightly superior, with the higher ones displaying a propensity to agree with the statement ""when a woman uses short or tight clothing, provokes harassment"". The factorial analysis came out with the following outputs: The Violence Acceptance Scale gave evidence for three factors (general alpha=.83). Factor 1 corresponding to the ""family violence acceptance"" dimension (α=.89). Factor 2 ""violent disciplinary strategies acceptance"" (α=.71). Factor 3 ""military violence acceptance"" (α=.67). The Rape Myth Scale came out with two factors (alpha general =.85). Factor 1 corresponding to ""the woman's culpability"" dimension (α=.82). Factor 2 corresponds to ""invulnerability/culpability"". Invulnerability implies beliefs sustaining that raped women deserve such assaults if they have behaved ""inappropriately"". Culpability justifies the reasons by which a man can not be raped and puts blame on men who are raped (a=.80). In the other hand, the intra- and inter-correlation between the scales dimensions demonstrates a greater acceptance of the violent disciplinary strategies and a significant association with the acceptance of family violence. The acceptance of family violence was the dimension more closely associated with a woman's culpability and a man's invulnerability beliefs. That is to say, that those who consider acceptable to beat their couple or child, have a tendency to blame women for their own rape and believe that men can not be raped at all. The acceptance of violent disciplinary strategies is associated, in a lower level, with women's culpability and men's rape invulnerability. Military violence acceptance nearly correlated with women's culpability but it did not correlate at all with men's vulnerability. Discussion: This is a study on a very common current issue, which is nevertheless relatively unknown in our country. Because of that, it is necessary to consider it as the beginning of an entire investigation line. This work has been made with a very specific and non-representative sample which prevents us from making generalizations. However, given the severity of the violence problem in our country, we consider that this first contribution could open new lines of research in terms of validation of instruments regarding the matter. The Violence Acceptance Scale showed well-defined dimensions as the one for family violence acceptance. The violent disciplinary strategies dimension reflects a kind of education used throughout history. The acceptance of military violence is evident as a form of institutional violence, which uses justification mechanisms that in many cases coerce some groups against others. The Rape Myth Scale obtained the first dimension, named ""raped women's culpability"". The second factor, ""men's rape invulnerability"", formed a dimension that reports a fake belief that man can not be raped. It is appropriate to say that military violence obtained the highest acceptation mean; such outcomes reveal the need to make further research on this particular subject. It is also necessary to do more exhaustive research on these topics, assuming that violence its not perceived as an isolated incident or set of practices, but rather as norms that are accepted or not depending on the context. A change is urgent in order to stop violence becoming customary in our societies. To accomplish that, human and material resources need to be mobilized so that a campaign against all kinds of violence can be developed to transform such events into ones that would not be tolerated by any society or culture.",0,0,0,1
"Health pattern of elderly according to age group who living alone in an urban area. PURPOSE: This study was conducted to identify the differences of health patterns; health-related characteristics, health behaviors, health problems, and self-care levels of elderly, living alone in an urban area according to age group. METHOD: The study design was a descriptive survey and the subjects were 1,800 elderly consisting of 937 young old, 704 middle old, and 159 old old. Data was collected from May to July 2003 using the structured questionnaire and analyzed by descriptive statistics, chi(2)-test, Fisher's exact probability test, ANOVA and Scheffe test using SPSS/PC. RESULT: The health related characteristics which involved body mass index, mental status, use of assistant devices, perceived health, concern of health, and social support were different among the groups and more aggravated by aging. Health behaviors and health problems were also significantly aggravated in the old old group. The self-care levels measured by ADL, physical activity, and self-care ability scores were also significantly decreased in the old old group. CONCLUSION: For the level of health status, health behaviors and self-care ability were significantly decreased by aging, health care services for the elderly should be planned considering the difference in the health pattern by age group.",1,0,0,1
"Psychiatric epidemiology of old age: The H70 study - The NAPE Lecture 2003. Objective: To describe methodological issues and possibilities in the epidemiology of old age psychiatry using data from the H70 study in Göteborg, Sweden. Method: A representative sample born during 1901-02 was examined at 70, 75, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 90, 92, 95, 97, 99 and 100 years of age, another during 1906-07 was examined at 70 and 79 years of age, and samples born between 1922 and 1930 were examined at 70 years of age. The study includes psychiatric examinations and key informant interviews performed by psychiatrists, physical examinations performed by geriatricians, psychometric testings, blood sampling, computerized tomographies of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid analyses, anthropometric measurements, and psychosocial background factors. Results: Mental disorders are found in approximately 30% of the elderly, but is seldom detected or properly treated. Incidence of depression and dementia increases with age. The relationship between blood pressure and Alzheimer's disease is an example of how cross-sectional and longitudinal studies yield completely different results. Brain imaging is an important tool in epidemiologic studies of the elderly to detect silent cerebrovascular disease and other structural brain changes. The high prevalence of psychotic symptoms is an example of the importance to use several sources of information to detect these symptoms. Dementia should be diagnosed in all types of studies in the elderly, as it influences several outcomes such as mortality, blood pressure, and rates of depression. Suicidal feelings are rare in the elderly and are strongly related to mental disorders. Conclusion: Modern epidemiologic studies in population samples should be longitudinal and include assessments of psychosocial risk factors as well as comprehensive sets of biologic markers, such as brain imaging, neurochemical analyses, and genetic information to maximize the contribution that epidemiology can provide to increase our knowledge about the etiology of mental disorders.",1,0,0,1
"Selected As the Best Paper in the 1990s: Reducing Frailty and Falls in Older Persons: An Investigation of Tai Chi and Computerized Balance Training. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of two exercise approaches, tai chi (TC) and computerized balance training (BT), on specified primary outcomes (biomedical, functional, and psychosocial indicators of frailty) and secondary outcomes (occurrences of fall). DESIGN: The Atlanta Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies and Intervention Techniques, a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with three arms (TC, BT, and education (ED)). Intervention length was 15 weeks, with primary outcomes measured before and after intervention and at 4-month follow-up. Falls were monitored continuously throughout the study. SETTING: Persons aged 70 and older living in the community. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 200 participants, 162 women and 38 men; mean age was 76.2. MEASUREMENTS: Biomedical (strength, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, body composition), functional instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and psychosocial well-being (Center for Epidemiological Studies for Depression scale, fear of falling questionnaire, self-perception of present and future health, mastery index, perceived quality of sleep, and intrusiveness) variables. RESULTS: Grip strength declined in all groups, and lower extremity range of motion showed limited but statistically significant changes. Lowered blood pressure before and after a 12-minute walk was seen following TC participation. Fear of falling responses and intrusiveness responses were reduced after the TC intervention compared with the ED group (P=.046 and P=.058, respectively). After adjusting for fall risk factors, TC was found to reduce the risk of multiple falls by 47.5%. CONCLUSION: A moderate TC intervention can impact favorably on defined biomedical and psychosocial indices of frailty. This intervention can also have favorable effects upon the occurrence of falls. TC warrants further study as an exercise treatment to improve the health of older people.",1,1,1,1
"Network size and support in old age: Differentials by socio-economic status in childhood and adulthood. This paper examines the impact of childhood and adulthood socio-economic status (SES) on personal network characteristics in later life. Data are derived from 2,285 married older adults (born between 1903 and 1937) who participated in face-to-face interviews for the Dutch survey on 'Living arrangements and social networks of older adults' conducted in 1992. Childhood and adulthood SES were indicated by the father's and own level of education and occupation. Multivariate analyses showed that SES in adulthood has more impact on network features in old age than father's SES. People with low lifetime SES or with downward SES mobility had small networks, low instrumental and emotional support from non-kin, but high instrumental support from kin, when compared with the upwardly mobile or those with high lifetime SES. The level of education was a better indicator of network differences than occupational prestige. It is concluded that obtaining a high SES during life pays off in terms of having more supportive non-kin relationships in old age. The small networks and less supportive non-kin relationships of low-status older adults make them more vulnerable to situations in which kin are unavailable or less willing to provide support. This study underscores the distinction between types of support and types or relationships in the SES-network association. Further research on the social pathways of socio-economic inequality in health and wellbeing should take these distinctions into account.",1,0,0,0
"Attitudes towards rehabilitation needs and support from assistive technology and the social environment among elderly people with disability. This study aimed to survey the attitudes of elderly people with disabilities who were living at home regarding their support from assistive technology and the social environment. These attitudes were compared with their identified needs by an occupational therapist and in relation to perception of social engagement, loneliness and overall contentment with life. From a sample of 102 participants who were interviewed using a standardized procedure, 53 persons were included in the study. The results indicated that attitudes among elderly people towards social and occupational engagement and change have a greater influence on their rehabilitation status than their disability as indicated by their health condition and limitations in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. The elderly people who accepted rehabilitation were more able, and were better equipped and better supported with assistive technology, than those who declined rehabilitation. Rehabilitation needs that the occupational therapists recognized were not always shared by the disabled elderly people, for several reasons; one reason of particular importance was the elderly person's attitude towards change and social engagement. However, the small sample size limits the generalization of the findings to the population of elderly people with disabilities. An ethnographic research design that allows for repeated interviews and observations of elderly people with disabilities for a prolonged period of time in their ordinary everyday lives may present an avenue for future research and lead to a deeper understanding of the issues.",1,0,0,1
"Ethnographic research on the experience of Japanese elderly people online. Elderly people in Japan are becoming part of virtual communities. This article explores the online experience of such people, how they interact with others and how they construct social support relationships via computer-mediated communication (CMC). This ethnographic research, through participant observation and in-depth interviews, reveals that these elderly people enjoy interaction in a variety of language forms, ranging from haiku to emoticons, by combining traditional text-based Japanese culture with a new virtual culture, despite the limitations of text-based communication. Also, both the immediacy and asynchrony of CMC helps them to construct real human relationships in the virtual community, including social connectedness to others as well as supportive and companionship relationships. The elderly people could create a sense of greater propinquity by sharing their old stories and memories.",1,0,0,0
"Composition and cost of drugs stored at home by elderly patients. BACKGROUND: Elderly people often have multiple chronic diseases, are frequently treated by several physicians, and also use over-the-counter medications. Excessive prescribing, imperfect therapeutic adherence, treatment modifications after hospitalization, and oversized drug packages result in home storage of leftover drugs, resulting in a waste of healthcare resources. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients aged ≥75 years hospitalized for >24 hours during a 6-month period in an urban teaching hospital in Switzerland were eligible for inclusion in a study collecting sociodemographics, medical, functional, and psychosocial characteristics. Six months later, a research nurse visited the patients at home and recorded the names, number of tablets, and expiration dates of all open or intact drug packages, and the doses actually taken. Acquisition costs of these drugs were computed. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-five patients were included (127 women; mean age 82.2 ± 4.8 y, range 75-96). They had a total of 2059 drugs (mean per patient 10.3 ± 6.7, range per patient 1-42), corresponding to a total cost of (US) $62 826 (mean per patient 322 ± 275, range per patient 10-1571). Self-reported drug intake was regular for 36% of the drugs (46.5% of total costs) and occasional for 11% (6.1%), whereas 35.7% (30.1%) had been stopped during the last month. Cardiovascular drugs amounted to 36.6% of the drugs and 55.5% of the costs. None of the patients' characteristics was significantly associated with a greater number of drugs and higher costs. CONCLUSIONS: Drugs stored at home by elderly patients were worth about $320 per patient. Only about one-third of these drugs were regularly taken. In the context of resources shortage, innovative solutions should be found to reduce the waste linked with drugs stopped in previous months.",1,1,1,1
"Factors related to self-concept of elderly residing in a retirement center. The purpose of this study was to explore the self-concept of elderly adults residing in retirement centers as well as its relationship to other variables, including function of activities of daily living (ADL), subjective well being, etc. Selected demographic attributes (sex, age, years of education etc.) were also examined for their relationship to self-concept. The subjects were a convenience sample of people aged 65 or older who were recruited from a retirement center in the south of Taiwan (N = 42), and a control group of elderly living with their family (N = 33). The Tennes see Self-Concept Scale (TSCS) was used to measure self-concept. The Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire-Chinese Version (MFAQ) was applied to measure the function of activities of daily living. A total of 37 subjects from the retirement center group and 28 subjects from the home group completed these questionnaires. The data were analyzed using SPSS/PC software version 10.0. After multiple linear regression analysis, the results showed that he elderly residing in the retirement center had significantly lower Personal Self and Family Self scores. The variables of ADL, sex and subjective well-being had effects on the total self-concept. Female elderly individuals also revealed significant higher scores than males in the subscales of Moral-Ethical, Family Self, Social Self, Identity, Satisfaction Self. These results suggest we should design appropriate programs to increase elderly people's interaction with others and establish new social networks for them which may enhance a sense of positive self-concept. © 2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",1,0,0,1
"Defining 'early dementia' and monitoring intervention: What measures are useful in family caregiving?. Measures of cognition are often used to define and measure the progress of dementia and outcomes of intervention. This paper examines whether measures of psychosocial disability used with those of cognition are more useful than measures of cognition alone, particularly in early dementia. A measure of cognition and two instruments of caregiver burden, used as routine clinical outcome measures of three types of Old Age Psychiatry dementia services, were examined. All cases with dementia in a memory clinic (MC; n = 149), a community mental health service for older people (CMHT; n = 120) and a specialist dementia day hospital (DH; n = 118), in one NHS district were followed up at 12 months. Measures of cognition (MMSE), behaviour, caregiver coping (Problem Checklist; PC) and caregiver mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HAD) were taken at baseline (MC, n = 48; CMHT, n = 113; DH, n = 55) and at follow-up (MC, n = 35; CMHT, n = 34; DH, n = 23). At baseline, all three groups had an average MMSE score of 'mild impairment' but measures of behaviour and caregiver burden showed subtle between-group differences. At the 12-month follow-up, cognition remained stable in all groups, but the frequency of day-to-day problems increased and caregiver mood deteriorated in families receiving DH support. The use of psychosocial measures of disability in conjunction with those of cognition, are important in the definition and longitudinal measurement of intervention and support in early dementia.",0,1,0,0
"Elderly people and new communication technologies [Los mayores y las nuevas tecnologías de la comunicación]. Introduction: In an aged society, it's necesary to establish new alternatives, that somehow try to satisfy the needs of elderly people and that at the same time increase their quality of life. On this sense, the new technologies, such as computer science, have become a basic tool of our society, and the elderly, without no doubt will be able to benefit from it. The objective of the present work is to know what the elderly think about themes related to computer science and internet, as well as their capacity of accessing to new technologies, and the knowledge that they have about them. Methods: A standarized interview has been made, it's self designed, to a sample of 105 elderly people living in the city of A Coruña. Results: Although most elderly people don't have a personal computer neither have worked with a computer application, would like to learn more about this field. When they are connected to internet they do it from social and/or educative centres, not having great problems neither in its handling or navigation. Conclusions: It's necessary to promote the use of computer science on the elderly people, since in a future it can constitute an essential tool in the intervention on inherent problems to aging such as isolation or loneliness among others.",1,0,0,1
"A randomized controlled trial of the psychosocial impact of providing internet training and access to older adults. The Internet (electronic mail and the World Wide Web) may provide new opportunities for communication that can help older adults avoid social isolation. This randomized controlled trial assessed the psychosocial impact of providing Internet access to older adults over a five-month period. One hundred volunteers from four congregate housing sites and two nursing facilities were randomly assigned to receive Internet training or to a wait list control group. The pre & post measures included the UCLA Loneliness scale, modified CES Depression scale, a measure of locus of control, computer attitudes, number of confidants, and overall quality of life. Participants received nine hours of small group training in six sessions over two weeks. Computers were available for continued use over five months and the trainer was available two hours/week for questions. At the end of the trial, 60% of the intervention group continued to use the Internet on a weekly basis. Although there was a trend toward decreased loneliness and depression in intervention subjects compared to controls, there were no statistically significant changes from baseline to the end of trial between groups. Among Internet users (n = 29) in the intervention group there were trends toward less loneliness, less depression, more positive attitudes toward computers, and more confidants than among intervention recipients who were not regular users (n = 19) of this technology. Most elderly participants in this trial learned to use the Internet and the majority continued to use it on a weekly basis. The psychosocial impact of Internet use in this sample suggested trends in a positive direction. Further research is needed to determine more precisely, which older adults, residing in which environmental contexts are more likely than others to benefit from this rapidly expanding information and communication link.",1,1,1,0
"Suicidality in older African Americans: Findings from the EPOCH study. The authors examined the current frequency of suicidality and associated characteristics in a sample of 835 African-American older adult residents of six urban public housing developments who consented to participate in an intervention trial of mobile outreach. The frequency of passive and active suicidal ideation was 2.5% and 1.4%, respectively. Characteristics of individuals with both active and passive suicidality included elevated anxiety, social dysfunction, somatic symptoms, low social support, lack of a confidant, and low religiosity. Characteristics of those with passive, but not active, ideation also included older age, lower levels of education, elevated depressive symptoms, poorer cognitive functioning, and having recently discussed emotional problems with a healthcare provider. The characteristics of those reporting active, but not passive, ideation included having a history of mental health treatment and reporting no instrumental support. Multivariate analyses indicated that depression and religiosity were uniquely associated with passive suicidal ideation, and life satisfaction and religiosity were uniquely associated with active suicidal ideation. The authors discuss implications of these findings and offer suggestions for research and clinical practice.",1,1,1,0
"Prevalence of pain in the Spanish population: Telephone survey in 5000 homes. Pain has become the most common accompanying symptom in patients seeking medical advice, and it is one of the main issues in public health. In Spain, there are no reliable data about the impact of pain in general population. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of acute and chronic pain in the Spanish general population. An epidemiological observational population-based cross-sectional study was carried out by means of a telephone survey. Multistep stratified quota-adjusted sampling was performed with people aged 18-95 years. A computer-assisted questionnaire was administered, covering physical pain symptoms, site, frequency, perceived cause, therapeutic measures and interference with daily life activities. There were 11 980 useful contacts, with 5000 effective interviews (42% of useful sample). Of the interviewees, 29.6% (95% confidence interval, 28.3-30.8%) reported having had pain the day before (women, 37.6%; men, 20.9%) and 43.2% the week before. Most common pain sites were lower extremities (22.7%) and back (cervical and lumbar levels) (21.5%), followed by head (20.5%). Frequency of pain increased with age, reaching 42.6% for people older than 65 years. Among people complaining of pain during the last day or week, duration of symptoms was higher than 3 months in 54% (chronic pain), representing 23.4% of the Spanish general population; most common causes of chronic pain were arthritis, rheumatism and migraine. Regarding treatment, 61.7% of people complaining of pain said they were taking drugs. Source of drug treatment advice was a physician or a nurse in 66.4% of cases and self-prescription in 29%. It is concluded that pain, particularly chronic pain, has a high prevalence in the Spanish general population and a significant impact on occupational and social relationships. © 2002 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain.",0,0,0,0
"Can we manage without the mental hospital?. Objectives: Many developed countries, having invested massively in psychiatric hospitals in the past 150 years, are in the process of dismantling them. The central question is whether this change in the location of care from the psychiatric hospital to district-based services has benefited the patients. The objectives of this review are to examine the evidence on which an answer to the above question might be based. Method: Much of the relevant research comes from the 13-year programme of the Team for the Assessment of Psychiatric Services conducted in London, but other research will be reviewed as appropriate. Results and conclusions: Long-stay, non-demented patients, including the elderly, enjoy a better quality of life in the community homes compared with the psychiatric hospitals. Public attitudes constitute an obstacle to social integration into the healthy community, but can be ameliorated with local educational programmes. The provision of work has been unsatisfactory, but the development of social firms holds some promise. Patients with dementia receive better care in community nursing homes compared with hospital wards, according to their relatives' opinions, backed up by observational studies. The part of the service which is most unsatisfactory is the admission facilities. This is due to a variety of causes, including a failure to plan for the admission needs of discharged long-stay patients, the virtual absence of rehabilitation units in the community and an inadequate provision of a range of sheltered accommodation. However, these problems could be resolved with adequate investment in innovative facilities.",0,0,0,1
"Depression in older people with mild stroke, carotid stenosis and peripheral vascular disease: A comparison with healthy controls. Background. Although depression has a recognised association with stroke, the role of 'silent' cerebrovascular pathology associated with carotid stenosis and peripheral vascular disease remains unexplored. Methods. Four groups of 25 community residents aged 65 and over were recruited, comprising first anterior circulation stroke, carotid stenosis accompanied by transient ischaemic attack, peripheral vascular disease and a non-vascular control group. All participants were interviewed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD] (including a modified version) and Geriatric Depression Scale. DSM IV criteria for major depression and measures of handicap, social support and physical illness were also administered. Head computerised tomography (CT) scans were performed on stroke patients to examine the relationship between lesion location and depression. Results. One hundred patients were interviewed. Stroke patients were more likely to live in a nursing home and had less social support than other groups. Mean scores on the modified Hamilton and Geriatric Depression Scales were higher in stroke and carotid stenosis groups than controls. Patients with stroke did not show a higher prevalence of DSM IV major depressive disorder than those with carotid stenosis. There was no relationship between the presence of lesions affecting the frontal/subcortical system and prevalence/severity of depression. Limitations. Small numbers, mortality of stroke patients in hospital, possible selection bias in the control group and use of a previously unvalidated depression rating scale all limit the study. Conclusions. A possible role for carotid stenosis in the pathogenesis of depressive disorder is suggested. Larger studies incorporating brain imaging may be required to examine the mechanism of this association more closely. The use of a shorter version of the HRSD in older people with cerebrovascular disease may warrant further exploration. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",1,0,0,1
"The psychosocial impact of interactive computer use within a vulnerable elderly population: A report on a randomized prospective trial in a home health care setting. Quality of care for vulnerable elderly clients makes it important to consider the psychosocial effects of interactive computer use as a means to communicate for social, functional, and/or health care purposes in a home health care setting. In a 3-month randomized prospective trial, telecommunications terminals were installed in the private residences of computer-illiterate persons, 65-years-of-age and older, providing visiting nurses the opportunity to teach computer use with three different training methods. The control group had similar weekly nurse visits, but no computer terminal use. Pre-posttests using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale compared change in self-esteem and depression scores of computer-use clients with the scores of the control group clients. Interactive computer use, alone, did not significantly change scores. Compared to the control group, however, there was a significant change toward improved self-esteem and depression when interactive computer use was accompanied with weekly nurse computer training. Weekly training with a significant other, as a substitute for the nurse trainer, significantly improved self-esteem scores but not depression scores. Interactive computer use was not associated with decreased self-esteem or increased depression. Attitude changes and responses to the particular telecommunication service used in this study were mixed, suggesting future research should be based on improved telecommunication systems with access to programs that have greater practical application to the needs of elderly clients.",1,1,1,0
"Arthritis care: Comparison of physicians' and patients' views. Objectives: To understand the expressed needs of physicians and their patients with respect to arthritis care, identify areas of agreement and disagreement in doctor and patient views of arthritis care, and to determine the types of educational programs needed. Methods: Focus group interviews were conducted with 14 physicians of varied specialties and 12 patients with arthritis from Oxford Health Plans. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. Analyses were performed by using text processing programs from the Unix computer operating system. Common themes were identified and summarized. Results: Physicians and patients agreed that pain and loss of functioning were the most important problems patients with arthritis faced and that arthritis was incurable. Both agreed that doctors need more time to discuss individual concerns with their patients. More information about diet and exercise and strategies for reducing social isolation were needed. Doctors and patients disagreed about the value of nutritional supplements, joint replacement, and referrals to specialists. Disagreement also existed regarding the belief that pain was an inevitable part of the aging process, and with respect to the use of drug and surgical therapy. Conclusions: Areas of agreement and disagreement were discussed. Collaboration and negotiation were identified as constructive responses to conflicts between physicians and patients. Patients need to be taught self-care strategies to minimize the impact of arthritis on their daily lives. The specific continuing education needs of physicians involved training in exercise, nutrition, occupational and physical therapy, prescriptions, and alternative medicine. Copyright (C) 2000 by W.B.

"Application of a geriatric evaluation protocol in primary care: comparison with data from the clinical history [Aplicación de un protocolo de valoración geriátrica en atención primaria: comparación con los datos de la historia clínica.]. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of the health problems included in a multidimensional geriatric assessment (MGA) protocol and to compare them with the problems detected in the clinical histories (CH) of the population consulting at a primary care centre (PCC). DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational. SETTING: Urban PCC (metropolitan area of Barcelona). PATIENTS: Users > or = 65 of a PCC between 01/11/97 and 31/01/98. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A random sample of 114 people was chosen. The MGA protocol was used to screen disorders in: hearing, vision, mobility, affective state, cognitive state, social support, functionalism of the instrumental activities of daily life. The clinical histories provided age, sex and information previously recorded on these disorders. 102 people were surveyed (participation: 89.5%). The MGA enabled more problems to be detected, with the difference very marked in some cases such as visual disorders: 55.9% (46.2-65.5) with MGA and 23.5% (15.3-31.8) with CH. There was poor concordance between MGA and CH. For example, neither the 73.3% (54.1-87.7) of the hearing disorders detected with the MGA, nor 94.1% (71.3-99.8) of the cognitive deterioration detected with the MGA had been previously recorded in the CH. CONCLUSIONS: MGA detects more health problems than are normally recorded in primary care clinical histories, which makes this technique relevant to PC consultations with the elderly. However, it would be advisable to identify the population for whom there was better diagnostic performance.",1,0,0,1
"Getting the questions right: An example of loss of validity during transfer of a brief screening approach for depression in the elderly. Screening for depression in the elderly has been advocated to improve detection and management. This article summarises the trend towards briefer screening instruments, and the integration of mental health screening with other assessments. The study aimed to validate a single question depression screen which had previously shown adequate sensitivity and specificity in a new context: a multi-faceted assessment instrument used by nurse practitioners within a community sample of over 75 years olds. The GMS-AGECAT computerised interview assessment was used as a 'gold standard' to determine the accuracy of the depression question in this new setting. Three hundred and twenty-eight patients were screened by their own nurse practitioners, of whom 100 consenting patients underwent a further interview with a research assistant using the GMS-AGECAT. The prevalence of depression was 30%, the sensitivity of the question was 67%, and its specificity 60% (compared with 88% and 71% previously). Responses indicating disability and loneliness were more closely correlated with depression than the depression screen itself. Relevant factors may include: the derivation of the question, the effect of a different sample, altered reliability when used by multiple interviewers, differing patient expectations, and the wording and context of the question within the multi-faceted screening instrument. Depression screening questions need repeated validation when used in different contexts. Patient and staff expectations may influence how screening instruments are used in practice in a way that may also alter reliability. Further studies are needed to establish the causes of loss of validity when screening approaches are used in new settings. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.",1,0,0,0
"Community-based case-control study of depression in older people. Cases and sub-cases from the MRC-ALPHA study. Background: Risk factors of depression in later life, particularly for sub-cases and for psychotic and neurotic types of depression, are unclear. Aims: To identify such risk factors. Method: Over 5200 older people (≥65 years), randomly selected from Liverpool, were interviewed using the Geriatric Mental State (GMS) and the Minimum Data Set (MDS). The computer- assisted diagnosis AGECAT identified 483 cases and 575 sub-cases of depression and 2451 with no mental problems. Logistic regression was employed to examine factors relevant to caseness. Results: In multiple logistical regression, odds ratios (ORs) were significantly high for being female (2.04,95% CI 1.56-2.69), widowed (2.00, 1.18-3.39), having alcohol problems (4.37, 1.40-2.94), physical disablement (2.03, 1.40-2.94), physical illness (1.98, 1.25-3.15), taking medications to calm down (10.04, 6.41-15.71), and dissatisfaction with life (moderate 4.54, 3.50-5.90; more severe 29.00, 16.00-52.59). Good social networks reduced the ORs. If sub-cases were included as controls, the statistical significance was reduced. Conclusions: Age was not associated with depression in later life whereas gender, physical disablement and dissatisfaction with life were. The sub-cases shared many risk factors with cases, suggesting that prevention may need to be attempted at an early stage. Declaration of interest: Funding from the Medical Research Council.",1,0,0,1
"Social mobility and health related behaviours in young people. Study objective - To assess the influences related to social mobility, particularly health related behaviours, as one potential explanation for the social class variation in health among adults. Design - The study is based on questionnaire data from the Adolescent Health and Lifestyle Surveys of 1985, 1987, and 1989. Setting - The whole of Finland. Participants - A representative sample of 8355 adolescents. The response rate was 79%. Measurement and main results - The relation between social mobility and health related behaviours among 16 and 18 year old young people was studied. The measure of social mobility was based on a combination of the social class of origin and achieved social position measured by the present educational status, educational attainment, and labour market position. Three mobility groups were constructed: the downwardly mobile, the upwardly mobile and the stable. Health related behaviours in an upwardly or downwardly mobile group were compared with a stable group from the same social class of origin by calculating relative risks (RR). RRs were assessed by calculating age and sex adjusted rate ratios approximating a Mantel-Haenszel estimate. In logistic regression analyses the independent effects of the social class of origin and the achieved social position were investigated. Most of the nine behaviours studied (smoking, alcohol use, heavy intoxication, coffee drinking, tooth brushing, consumption of sweets, lack of physical exercise, choice of bread spread, and consumption of milk) were related to the direction of mobility so that health compromising behaviours were more frequent among downwardly mobile and less frequent among upwardly mobile young people than their stable peers. Achieved social position proved to determine health related behaviours more strongly than class of origin, thus emphasising the way education facilitates both health values and behaviours as well as the future social position. Conclusions - The close relation between social mobility and health related behaviours is concluded to be a part of an explanation of social class differences in health observed among adults.",0,0,0,1
"The power of ageism on physical function of older persons: Reversibility of age-related gait changes. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that age-associated changes in physical function, particularly walking performance, are influenced by ageism and that the activation of positive sterotypes of aging can partially reverse these changes. DESIGN: Randomized intervention study. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-seven community-dwelling men and women (63-82 years old) who walked independently and described themselves as healthy. INTERVENTION: Thirty-minute exposure to the subconscious reinforcement of either a positive or negative stereotype of aging while subjects played a computer game. MEASUREMENTS: Pre- and postintervention measures of gait speed and percent swing time (the time spent with one foot in the air during walking). Health and psychosocial status were also evaluated. RESULTS: Significant increases in walking speed (9% ± 2%; P < .001) and percent swing time (percent change: 1.1% ± 0.4%; P = .023) were observed in subjects who received reinforcement of positive stereotypes of aging. Gait speed and swing time did not change in those who received reinforcement of negative stereotypes of aging. The observed improvements in gait were related to the positive intervention, but were not related to age, gender, health status, or psychosocial status. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotypes of aging apparently have a powerful impact on the gait of older persons. Interventions designed to enhance perceptions of old age may prove beneficial in helping to improve gait and functional independence among older persons. In the future, positive changes in society's view of aging may also help to reduce and prevent age- related declines in function and the associated deleterious consequences.",1,1,1,1
"Elderly, poor, solitary and marginal patients: geriatric vulnerability in emergency services [Viejos, pobres, solitarios y marginados: vulnerabilidad geriátrica en un servicio de urgencias.]. BACKGROUND: Status is a powerful determinant of health, and it may influence on the demand of Hospital emergency services. The aim of our investigation is to assess whether elderly patients usually wandering emergency services gather more negative socioeconomic conditions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 800 randomised patients cared in emergency services was carried out. A questionnaire about economic, educational and professional levels, domestic violence, loneliness and life style was applied. A crude analysis was used to assess the age-factor (>/= 65 y.o.) by BMDP (PC 90). The trial was approved by the local Bioethics board. RESULTS: Low incomes, low educational level and loneliness were clinic and statistically related with age (65 and more). Data is offered as n (%), X2 and p < 0.0001 (Fisher exact Test two sided p value). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients frequently demanding hospital emergency services gather more vulnerability conditions, not merely medical. Low incomes, low educational level and loneliness are probably working as key factors on the geriatric demand of emergency services.",1,0,0,1
"Coping behaviors of the elderly with positive physical examination results in Kaohsiung City. The objectives of this study were as follows: first, to investigate the coping behaviors of the elderly facing the stress of disease after free physical examination; Second, to identify personal and disease characteristics, and the social support that influences coping behaviors in the elderly. The study sample consisted of 661 elderly patients who were found to have abnormal findings during a free physical examination provided by 11 regional health stations in Kaohsiung City. Data were collected with questionnaires through home interview. Four hundred and eighty-four subjects completed the questionnaires. Data were analyzed using SAS computer program. The major findings were as follows: 1.Problem-oriented coping behaviors were the more frequently used. The most frequently used coping behaviors were ""accepting the situation as it is"", ""reling on myself to solve problems"", ""hoping that things would get better"", ""seeking professional help"", and ""letting things follow their natural cause"". 2.The relative variables for problem-oriented coping were marital status, religion, medical insurance, educational level, disease characteristics, and social support. Sex, marital status, religion, medical insurance, perceived disease severity, characteristics of health problem, and newly found abnormality at this free physical examination were the relative variables for affective-oriented coping. 3.The best predictive variables for using problem-oriented coping behaviors were medical insurance, self-esteem support from family and friends, tangible support from health professionals, emotional support from health professionals, and whether it was the first time the patients knew their health problems. Findings from this study had implications for development of nursing care plans for elderly clients, as well as for collaborative team exploration of coping behaviors in the elderly.",1,0,0,0
"Functional decline in the elderly: Evidence for direct and stress- buffering protective effects of social interactions and physical activity. Advances in medical technology and improvements in health behavior have greatly increased the proportion of Americans who survive into old age. Consequently, identifying environmental and behavioral factors that enhance or protect the health and functional capacity of older adults is an important goal. This study investigated the extent to which social interactions and physical activity can protect older adults from the declines in functional ability that typically occur with age and the extent to which they buffer the negative effects of widowhood on physical functioning. Data were from the Longitudinal Study of Aging, a six-year follow-up of over 7,000 respondents in the 1984 National Health Interview Survey. Using individual growth curve models which examine the effects of predictor variables on change over time, this study investigated how physical activity, social interactions, and widowhood are related to the rate of change in functional health over a six- year period. Results suggested that physical activity and social interactions each exerted independent effects on functional decline. In addition, physical activity and social interactions buffered the effects of widowhood on functional decline, especially in men who died before the end of the study. Results suggest a need for health promotion programs to encourage both physical and social activities in the elderly.",1,0,0,0
"Effects of preventive health services on survival of the elderly living in a community in Osaka, Japan. Study objective - To examine the relationships between the use of preventive health services - such as health checks, basic health examination/cancer screening, and daily preventive health practices - and survival of elderly people living in the community. Design and setting - A cohort of elderly people aged 65 years and over living in Settsu city, Osaka was followed for 38 months. Data on the history of health management, disability scores, and psychosocial conditions were collected in October 1992 by interview during home visits. Subjects - Of the 1491 people randomly selected from the computerised sex-age register at enrollment, 1473 were contacted and responses were obtained from 1405 (95.4%). They constituted the study cohort. Follow up was completed for 1325 (94.3%) (154 deceased and 1171 alive). Measurements and main results - From the analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test, female sex, younger age group (65-74 years), use of health checks, use of basic health examination and/or cancer screening, use of daily preventive health practices, less disability, taking part in social activity, and finding life worth living were univariately statistically significantly related to survival. The estimated survival rates were highest in those with regular health checks or daily preventive health practices before 59 years of age or both basic health examination and cancer screening. From the Cox proportional hazards model, use of health checks and use of daily preventive health practices remained as statistically significant factors associated with survival, controlling for other factors such as sex, age group, medical treatment, disability scores, and psychosocial conditions, and these hazard ratios (not used v starting at 59 years) were 0.41 (95% CI, 0.25, 0.66) and 0.52 (95% CI, 0.30, 0.88), respectively. Conclusions - Health management efforts such as health checks and daily preventive health practices may increase survival in the elderly.",1,0,0,1
"Reducing frailty and falls in older persons: An investigation of Tai Chi and computerized balance training. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of two exercise approaches, Tai Chi (TC) and computerized balance training (BT), on specified primary outcomes (biomedical, functional, and psychosocial indicators of frailty) and secondary outcomes (occurrence of falls). DESIGN: The Atlanta FICSIT (Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques), a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with three arms (TC, BT, and education [ED]). Intervention length was 15 weeks, with primary outcomes measured before and after intervention and at 4-month follow-up. Falls were monitored continuously throughout the study. SETTING: Persons aged 70 and older living in the community. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 200 participants, 162 women and 38 men; mean age was 76.2. MEASUREMENTS: Biomedical (strength, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, body composition), functional (IADL), and psychosocial well-being (CES-D scale, fear of falling questionnaire, self- perception of present and future health, mastery index, perceived quality of sleep, and intrusiveness) variables. RESULTS: Grip strength declined in all groups, and lower extremity range of motion showed limited but statistically significant changes. Lowered blood pressure before and after a 12-minute walk was seen following TC participation. Fear of falling responses and intrusiveness responses were reduced after the TC intervention compared with the ED group (P = .046 and P = .058, respectively). After adjusting for fall risk factors, TC was found to reduce the risk of multiple falls by 47.5%. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate TC intervention can impact favorably on defined biomedical and psychosocial indices of frailty. This intervention can also have favorable effects upon the occurrence of falls. Tai Chi warrants further study as an exercise treatment to improve the health of older people.",1,1,1,1
"A mobile rehabilitation team program to assist patients in nursing homes rehabilitate and return to their homes. A slow-stream rehabilitation program for frail elderly patients was developed utilising nursing homes visited by a mobile rehabilitation team (MRT) based at the hospital from which these patients had been discharged following major illness. The nursing homes were able to provide physiotherapy and the MRT contributed medical, nursing, occupational therapy and social work support through weekly visits. The supported group and a control group (also discharged to nursing homes from the same hospital but unsupported) were matched for age, sex and ADL level. Outcomes for the two groups were compared and were significantly different. Of the supported group (N = 33), 64% (N = 21) were discharged home compared with only 9% (N = 2) of the 23 control subjects (χ2 = 15.6, df. = 1, P &lt; 0.05). The potential for patient rehabilitation in a modestly supported nursing home was realised. © 1995.",1,1,1,0
"A follow–up study of older stroke survivors living at home. Stroke often results in one or more serious long-term effects. Older persons who experience stroke typically experience other chronic conditions as well. This article analyzes coping strategies of home-based older people who experienced a stroke, focusing on use of assistive devices. In a sample of 35 older people with stroke, 20% had either moved into a nursing home or had died within 1 year of an initial interview. The remaining 27 older people were interviewed twice, at 1-year intervals. Comparisons were made to determine changes over 1 year for measures of health, functional status, and psychosocial status, as well as ownership, usage, and satisfaction with assistive devices. Three case studies are presented to illustrate how these older people use assistive technology in coping with the effects of stroke and their other chronic conditions. © 1995 Aspen Publishers, Inc.",1,0,0,0
"Burden of Dietary Therapy on Elerly Patients with Diabetes Mellitus.. As a part of a QOL study in elderly diabetes mellitus, we performed an interview conducted by professional interviewers on the sense of burden of dietary therapy in 383 elderly outpatients with diabetes mellitus aged over 60 years old. We used a scale on Burden of Dietary Therapy (BDT) that consisted of 7 questions (calorie restriction, dietary balance, regular dietary habits, restriction of favorite food, restriction of amounts of snacks, restrictions when eating out, burden of total dietary therapy). The sense of burden was rated from 1 (never burdened) to 4 (heavily burdened) for each question and the alpha coefficiency of the BDT scale was 0.80. Women, relatively younger elderly patients, hyperglycemic patients, or tablet-treated patients had higher BDT scale scores. The lower the positive family suport scores and the higher the negative social support scores, the greater was the BDT score. High BDT scores were significantly associated with low PGC moral scales (p≪.001). The results suggest that the burden of dietary therapy could lower the quality of life in elderly patients with diabetes mellitus. © 1995, The Japan Geriatrics Society. All rights reserved.",1,0,0,0
"Predicting Falls: The Role of Mobility and Nonphysical Factors. Our purpose was to test a four‐domain predictive model of recurrent falls developed for this study. In this model, limited mobility is considered a necessary but not sufficient element in risk of recurrent falls. Three other domains, attitudinal, social, and environmental, are proposed to influence fall risk only in persons with impaired mobility. Prospective cohort study. Veterans Affairs Ambulatory Care Service serving rural and urban central North Carolina. Male Veterans aged 70 or older (n = 306) were monitored prospectively for falls. At baseline, 159 screened as high‐risk mobility status and 147 as low‐risk mobility status. The primary outcome was recurrent falls. The mobility screen used for risk assignment defined immobile as unable to sit without support for 60 seconds, mobile and stable as meeting criteria for normal ambulation and stair climbing, and mobile but unstable as those who met neither of the above criteria. The high‐risk subjects were further assessed in their homes for mobility in more detail, attitude toward risk, social supports, and environmental status. Other data included demographics, functional status, diagnoses, and medications. Recurrent falls occurred in 37 (23.3%) high‐risk subjects and seven (4.8%) low‐risk subjects (relative risk = 4.8, confidence interval 2.5 to 9.6, P < 0.001). Within the high‐risk group, the probability of recurrent falls was significantly affected by degree of impaired mobility (P < 0.001), attitude toward risk (P = 0.005), and environment score (P = 0.03). A simple mobility screen can identify elders at increased risk for recurrent falls. Risk within this group is further modified by risk‐taking behavior and environment. © 1994 The American Geriatrics Society",1,0,0,0
"Preserving independence: The effectiveness of comprehensive geriatric assessment [ERHALTUNG DER SELBSTANDIGKEIT: WIRKSAMKEIT DES MULTIDIMENSIONALEN GERIATRISCHEN ASSESSMENT]. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is defined as the process of determining an elderly person's medical, psychosocial, functional, and environmental resources and problems, linked with an overall plan for treatment and follow-up. The principles of geriatric assessment, including the advantages and disadvantages of using quantitative instruments for multidimensional evaluation, are reviewed. The findings of a recently published meta-analysis on comprehensive geriatric assessment are discussed and its policy implications addressed. The meta-analysis includes data of 28 controlled trials comprising 4959 subjects allocated to one of five CGA types, and 4912 control subjects. Original investigators provided additional unpublished data from published reports to supplement the data base of this meta-analysis. The combined odds ratios of outcomes in CGA-assessed patients versus control patients were obtained by pooling data from individual trials with a multivariate logistic regression approach. The combined odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of home survival at 1 to 4-year follow-up was 1.7 (1.2-2.3) for inpatient geriatric evaluation and management units, 1.5 (1.1-2.0) for post-discharge home assessment services, and 1.2 (1.1-1.4) for preventive in-home assessment services. Based on these research findings, the establishment of interdisciplinary units with staff trained in multidimensional geriatric assessment for inpatient evaluation and management of frail elderly patients, is recommended. In addition, research to improve geriatric assessment technology and promote its integration into primary care has a great potential for disability prevention and nursing home use reduction in older persons.",1,1,1,0
"Clinical Correlates of Functional Status in Patients With Chronic Renal Insufficiency. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are known to have significantly reduced functional abilities, as measured by the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). We investigated the clinical correlates with SIP scores in a cohort of patients with lesser degrees of renal dysfunction recruited from an academic general medicine practice (mean calculated creatinine clearance, 25 mL/min). Of 603 eligible patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) defined as a serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and a calculated creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min on two occasions more than 6 months apart, 360 (60%) agreed to participate. These patients were primarily elderly (mean age, 69 years) black (83%), women (69.2%), with an average of 6 years of education and a household income of $400 to $800 per month; 92% had hypertension and 57% had diabetes. The SIP was administered in-home by trained interviewers. Independent variables included demographic data, education, income, and medications (via interviewers), vital signs taken by a renal nurse, and diagnostic test results and diagnoses from patient’s computerized records. The total SIP score was the dependent variable, and its physical and psychosocial subscales were also investigated. Variables with univariate correlations with total SIP (P < 0.05) were included in a multiple regression analysis. All variables with a multivariable P value less than 0.10 were included in the final model. The mean SIP score was 24.5 ± 15.6, higher than that found in patients on dialysis. Significant (P < 0.05) independent correlates with higher SIP scores (greater disability) were lower educational level and income, prior diagnoses of coronary artery disease and stroke, and lower serum albumin. Borderline correlations (0.05 < P < 0.10) with higher SIP scores were found for white patients and women, the diagnoses of congestive heart failure and osteoarthritis, and lower serum sodium. The effect of these variables was found mostly in the SIP physical subscale. No effect of generally used measures of renal function (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, creatinine clearance) was found. Patients with CRI are significantly disabled even before the development of ESRD, but in this population, the disability is correlated mostly with socioeconomic and comorbid conditions, not renal function. This model may help identify a subgroup of patients who would benefit from intensive outpatient management to improve function and prevent morbid events. © 1993, National Kidney Foundation.

"Risk factors for depression in elderly people: a prospective study. In 1982‐1983 a random sample of 1486 people aged 65 years and above was generated from general practitioner lists; 1070 were interviewed in the community using the Geriatric Mental State and a Social History questionnaire. The cohort was followed up by interview 3 years later. At year 3 the diagnostic computer program AGECAT diagnosed 44 incident cases of depression. Information from the depressed group's initial and further interviews was compared with a control group (which excluded cases of affective or organic mental illness). Univariate analysis yielded three factors that were significantly associated with the development of depression 3 years later: a lack of satisfaction with life; feelings of loneliness; and smoking. Multivariate analysis confirmed their independent effects and revealed 2 further factors attaining significance: female gender and a trigger factor, bereavement of a close figure within 6 months of the third‐year diagnosis. Some other factors traditionally associated with depression, such as poor housing, marital status and living alone, failed to attain significance as risk factors. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

"Family structure and mental illness in old age. A random sample of subjects aged over 60 in the community was studied. Out of 181 subjects studied 50 were found to suffer from functional disorders such as depression and anxiety, and 11 from organic brain syndrome. 120 are found psychiatrically normal. Over 50% of the elderly subjects studied were widowed and about 70% were unemployed and nearly 80% belonged to lower middle class and low socio-economic group. The families of the elderly subjects and their living condition were studied in detail. The family was divided into 'joint', 'nuclear' and loosely joint' on the basis of living arrangement financial support and other help they received. Functional disorder was found high in old age subjects living in nuclear family and living alone. 33 Psychosocial variables affecting the health of the elderly subjects were studied and their correlation to psychiatric illness was determined by computer. Further factorial analysis was carried out, and three factors were extracted. It was found that Factor II and Factor III were about family and living conditions. Hence it could be stated that the family and living conditions are significant factors affecting the mental health of the elderly subjects.",1,0,0,0
